# AI Assistant Onboarding Guide

**Purpose**: This document is the **primary entry point** for AI assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.) picking up this project. It explains where to find information and how to get context quickly.

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

If the user says "read the docs and get up to speed", do this:

1. **Read this file first** (you're already here ‚úì)
2. **Read [README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview, installation, usage
3. **Read [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)** - High-level architecture
4. **Check [Claude Sessions/](Claude%20Sessions/)** - Previous session context (if continuing)
5. **Browse [decisions/](decisions/)** - ADRs for architectural decisions

**Total reading time: 5-10 minutes**

## When to Read What

### Scenario 1: New to the Project

**User says**: "Help me understand this codebase" or "What does this project do?"

**You should**:
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) - Get project overview
2. Read [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) - Understand architecture
3. Ask user what they want to work on

### Scenario 2: Continuing from Previous Session

**User says**: "I'm continuing from a previous session" or "Read the session summary"

**You should**:
1. Read [Claude Sessions/README.md](Claude%20Sessions/README.md) - Understand continuation system
2. Find latest `SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` in [Claude Sessions/](Claude%20Sessions/)
3. Read that summary completely
4. Continue work without asking questions already answered

### Scenario 3: Making Architectural Changes

**User says**: "Let's change how episode naming works" or "Refactor the chunking strategy"

**You should**:
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) - Current architecture
2. Read relevant ADR in [decisions/](decisions/) - Understand existing rationale
3. Read [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) - See how it fits overall
4. Propose changes, discuss tradeoffs
5. **After implementing**: Create new ADR or update existing one

### Scenario 4: Debugging Issues

**User says**: "X isn't working" or "Why does Y happen?"

**You should**:
1. Check [Claude Sessions/](Claude%20Sessions/) - See if issue was encountered before
2. Read relevant code in [main.py](../main.py) or [graphiti_client.py](../graphiti_client.py)
3. Check [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) - Understand expected behavior
4. Debug and fix

### Scenario 5: Adding Features

**User says**: "Add feature X" or "Implement Y"

**You should**:
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) - Understand current feature set
2. Read [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) - Understand patterns to follow
3. Check [decisions/](decisions/) - See if related decisions exist
4. Implement feature following existing patterns
5. **After implementing**: Update docs, consider creating ADR if architectural

### Scenario 6: Committing Changes

**User says**: "Commit" or "Ready to commit" or "Let's commit this" or "commit"

**üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW - NEVER SKIP THIS**:

1. **Re-read [COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md](COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md)** - Even if you read it earlier, read it again NOW
   - Why? Context window may be filled with other work
   - The checklist ensures docs stay current
   - Takes 30 seconds, saves hours of future confusion

2. **Run through checklist automatically** (don't ask user about each item)
   - Check if ADR needed
   - Check if README needs update
   - Check if Architecture Overview needs update
   - Check if code comments sufficient

3. **Make doc updates** (ADR, README, Architecture Overview as needed)

4. **Generate commit message** with context and doc references

5. **Show user** what docs were updated and proposed commit message

6. **Ask for approval** to commit

**IMPORTANT**:
- This is **automatic**. User doesn't want to be asked about each checklist item.
- You check the list, update docs, then show results.
- **ALWAYS re-read COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md** when user says "commit", even if context is full.

## Key Concepts (Quick Reference)

### ResearchSession State Machine
```
TASKING ‚Üí RESEARCH ‚Üí REFINEMENT ‚Üí COMMIT ‚Üí COMPLETE
             ‚Üë           ‚Üì
             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò (loop for deep research)
```

### Episode-Based Architecture
- **Episode**: A discrete unit of research committed to knowledge graph
- **Why**: Optimal chunking (1,400-2,600 tokens) for Graphiti entity extraction
- **How**: One episode per worker (4 per research session)

### Episode Naming
- **Generated by**: LLM (Claude)
- **Approved by**: User
- **When**: Before folders are created
- **Format**: "{Session Name} - {Worker Role}"

### Folder Structure
```
context/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {Episode_Name}/              # Session folder = initial episode name
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {Episode_Name}/          # Initial research folder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {Deep_Topic_1}/          # Deep research folders (clean names)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {Deep_Topic_2}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session.json             # Session metadata
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ narrative.txt            # Synthesized findings
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ refinement_context.json  # Refinement conversations
```

## Common Tasks (Quick Links)

### Understanding a Function
1. Search for function name in [main.py](../main.py)
2. Read function docstring
3. Check if it's referenced in [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)
4. Look for related ADR in [decisions/](decisions/)

### Changing Episode Naming
1. Read [001-episode-naming-strategy.md](decisions/001-episode-naming-strategy.md)
2. Modify `generate_episode_name()` in [main.py](../main.py)
3. Test with `python main.py`
4. Update ADR with changes

### Changing Graph Chunking
1. Read [002-graphiti-chunking-strategy.md](decisions/002-graphiti-chunking-strategy.md)
2. Modify `commit_research_episode()` in [main.py](../main.py)
3. Test in mock mode
4. Update ADR with changes

### Changing Episode Grouping
1. Read [003-episode-grouping-metadata.md](decisions/003-episode-grouping-metadata.md)
2. Modify metadata in `commit_research_episode()` in [main.py](../main.py)
3. Test graph queries
4. Update ADR with changes

## Documentation Philosophy

### For Humans
- **README.md**: Quick start, installation, usage
- **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md**: How the system works

### For AI
- **AI_ONBOARDING.md**: Navigation and quick reference (this file)
- **Claude Sessions/**: Detailed context from previous work
- **ADRs**: Rationale behind decisions

### For Both
- All docs use clear, concise language
- Code examples throughout
- File/line references for easy navigation
- Updated as project evolves

## File/Line Reference Format

When referencing code, use this format:

```
[filename.ts:42](../filename.ts#L42)              # Single line
[filename.ts:42-51](../filename.ts#L42-L51)       # Range
[directory/](../directory/)                        # Folder
```

This makes references **clickable** in IDEs and GitHub.

## Update Guidelines

### When to Update Docs

**README.md**: When project setup, usage, or key concepts change
**ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md**: When architecture, patterns, or design changes
**AI_ONBOARDING.md**: When doc structure or navigation changes
**ADRs**: When architectural decisions are made or revised
**Claude Sessions/**: Automatically on context limit or manual request

### Who Updates

- **AI assistants**: Update docs as part of implementing changes
- **Users**: Review and approve doc updates
- **Both**: Collaborate on ADRs for major decisions

## Best Practices for AI

### DO
‚úÖ Read docs before asking questions
‚úÖ Reference docs when explaining decisions
‚úÖ Update docs when making changes
‚úÖ Create ADRs for architectural changes
‚úÖ Use file/line references in explanations
‚úÖ Check session summaries for prior context

### DON'T
‚ùå Make changes without understanding rationale
‚ùå Skip updating docs after refactors
‚ùå Ignore existing patterns and conventions
‚ùå Ask questions answered in docs
‚ùå Create new doc files without good reason
‚ùå Duplicate information across docs

See [Claude Sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_2.md](Claude%20Sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_2.md) for detailed context.

## Communication Style

When working with this user:
- **Be concise**: User values clarity over verbosity
- **Reference docs**: Point to files/lines instead of repeating
- **Ask when unclear**: Don't guess architectural decisions
- **Show tradeoffs**: Explain pros/cons of approaches
- **Think like CTO**: User wants best engineering practices

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. **Check session summaries** - Was this solved before?
2. **Read relevant ADR** - Is there documented rationale?
3. **Ask user** - Explain what's unclear and why

## Meta: About This File

This file was created to solve a problem:

**Problem**: AI assistants waste time navigating docs, asking redundant questions, and missing prior context.

**Solution**: Single entry point (this file) that explains where everything is and when to read it.

**Result**: AI assistants get context in minutes, not hours. Users don't repeat themselves.

If this file isn't serving that purpose, update it or tell the user it needs improvement.
