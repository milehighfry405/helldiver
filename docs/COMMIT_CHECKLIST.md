# Commit Checklist for Claude Code

**Purpose**: This checklist ensures documentation stays current with code changes. Claude Code should follow this checklist **before every git commit**.

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Always Read This Before Committing

**If you don't remember this file, READ IT NOW before proceeding with any commit.**

Location: `docs/COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md`

**Why this matters**: Even if context window is full of other work, you MUST re-read this file when user says "commit" to ensure docs stay current.

---

## When User Says "Commit" or "Ready to commit"

**STEP 0**: If you haven't read this file recently, **READ IT NOW** before proceeding.

Claude Code must **automatically** run through this checklist without being asked:

### 1. Check if ADR Needed (Architecture Decision Record)

**Question**: Did this work involve an architectural decision?

**Architectural decisions include**:
- ‚úÖ Changing how data flows through the system
- ‚úÖ Adding/removing major components or modules
- ‚úÖ Changing API contracts or interfaces
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization strategies
- ‚úÖ Security/privacy design decisions
- ‚úÖ Database schema or storage decisions
- ‚úÖ Third-party integration patterns

**NOT architectural decisions**:
- ‚ùå Bug fixes with no design impact
- ‚ùå Adding comments or improving readability
- ‚ùå Small refactors following existing patterns
- ‚ùå Dependency version updates

**If YES** ‚Üí Create or update ADR in `docs/decisions/XXX-decision-name.md`

### 2. Check if README Needs Update

**Question**: Did this work change how users interact with the system?

**README changes needed if**:
- ‚úÖ Installation steps changed
- ‚úÖ Usage commands changed
- ‚úÖ New features added (user-facing)
- ‚úÖ Configuration options changed
- ‚úÖ Dependencies added/removed

**If YES** ‚Üí Update `README.md` with changes

### 3. Check if ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW Needs Update

**Question**: Did this work change system architecture or design patterns?

**Architecture overview changes needed if**:
- ‚úÖ State machine transitions changed
- ‚úÖ Data flow changed
- ‚úÖ New design patterns introduced
- ‚úÖ File structure changed
- ‚úÖ Key concepts changed

**If YES** ‚Üí Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`

### 3.5. Check if GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE Needs Update

**Question**: Did this work involve graph design decisions?

**Graph architecture changes needed if**:
- ‚úÖ Group ID strategy changed or decided
- ‚úÖ Custom entities added/removed/modified
- ‚úÖ Schema design changed
- ‚úÖ Integration patterns changed (Claude Skills, MCP, etc.)
- ‚úÖ New graph-related open questions identified

**If YES** ‚Üí Update `docs/GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### 3.6. Check if CURRENT_WORK Needs Update

**Question**: Did this work complete a task, answer a question, or create new next steps?

**Current work changes needed if**:
- ‚úÖ Completed an item from "Immediate Next Steps"
- ‚úÖ Answered an "Open Question"
- ‚úÖ Made progress on "Active Research Sessions"
- ‚úÖ Discovered new work that needs to be done
- ‚úÖ Changed priorities or focus

**If YES** ‚Üí Update `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md` with:
- Move completed items from "Next Steps" to "What We Just Figured Out"
- Update "Active Research Sessions" status
- Mark answered questions as resolved
- Add new next steps or open questions
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp

### 4. Check if Code Comments Sufficient

**Question**: Will future AI assistants understand WHY this code exists?

**Add comments if**:
- ‚úÖ Non-obvious design decisions in code
- ‚úÖ Workarounds for edge cases
- ‚úÖ Performance-critical sections
- ‚úÖ Complex algorithms

**Format**:
```python
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Reason for this design choice
# IMPORTANT: Critical behavior to maintain
# PERFORMANCE: Why this optimization matters
```

### 5. Generate Commit Message with Context

**Format**:
```
<type>: <short summary>

<detailed explanation>
- What changed (bullet points)
- Why it changed
- Impact on system

Documentation:
- [Updated/Created] <doc files changed>

See: docs/Claude Sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_X.md for full context
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`

- ‚ùå Architecture overview? NO - design unchanged
- ‚úÖ Code comments? Added comment explaining edge case
- ‚úÖ Commit message:
```
fix: Handle long episode names in filesystem creation

Now truncates to 200 chars with ellipsis.

Documentation:
- No doc changes (bug fix only)
```

### Example 2: New Feature (ADR Required)

## For Claude Code: How to Use This

### When user says: "commit" / "ready to commit" / "let's commit"

**Your workflow**:

1. **Read this file** (`docs/COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md`)
2. **Run through checklist automatically** (don't ask user about each item)
3. **Make doc updates** (ADR, README, Architecture Overview as needed)
4. **Show user** what docs you updated
5. **Generate commit message** following format above
6. **Ask user**: "Ready to commit with this message?"

### Example interaction

```
User: "Okay, commit this work"

Claude: "Running pre-commit checklist..."

[Claude checks checklist internally]

Claude: "Documentation updates made:
- Created docs/decisions/004-multilingual-research-strategy.md (new architectural decision)
- Updated README.md (new RESEARCH_LANGUAGE config)
- Updated docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md (new language flow)

Proposed commit message:

feat: Add multi-language support for research workers
...

Ready to commit?"

User: "Yes, commit it"

[Claude runs git commit]
```

---

## For User: Your Role

**You only need to**:
1. Say "commit" when ready
2. Review Claude's doc updates and commit message
3. Approve or request changes

**You don't need to**:
- Remember checklist items
- Decide which docs to update
- Write ADRs yourself
- Format commit messages

**Claude handles all that automatically** by following this checklist.

---

## Integration with Session Summaries

When commit message references session summary, use this format:

```
See: docs/Claude Sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_X.md for full context
```

This creates a **trail** from git history ‚Üí session summary ‚Üí complete context.

Future AI assistants can:
1. Read git log
2. See session summary reference
3. Read that summary for full context
4. Understand the journey, not just the destination

---

## Updating This Checklist

If user wants to add/remove checklist items, edit this file.

Claude Code will follow whatever this checklist says before commits.

---

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No mental overhead** - User just says "commit", Claude handles docs
‚úÖ **Consistent docs** - Checklist ensures nothing forgotten
‚úÖ **Git-integrated** - Ties into workflow user already knows
‚úÖ **Auditable** - Commit messages reference docs and summaries
‚úÖ **Future-proof** - Future AI reads commit ‚Üí summary ‚Üí full context

---

## TL;DR

**User**: "Commit"
**Claude**: Checks this file ‚Üí Updates docs ‚Üí Proposes commit message ‚Üí Asks approval
**User**: "Yes" (approves)
**Claude**: Commits with full context

That's it. Documentation stays current with zero user effort.
