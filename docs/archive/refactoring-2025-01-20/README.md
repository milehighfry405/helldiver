# Refactoring Archive - 2025-01-20

This folder contains the old codebase before the major refactoring that reduced the code from 2,228 lines in main.py to a clean modular architecture.

## Archived Files

### `main_old.py` (92,709 bytes)
- Original bloated main.py (2,228 lines)
- Contained duplicate code for initial vs deep research
- Monolithic structure with all logic in one file
- **Replaced by**: New modular main.py (440 lines) + core/workers/graph/utils modules

### `graphiti_client.py` (9,439 bytes)
- Original Graphiti client implementation
- **Replaced by**: `graph/client.py` (refactored with better connection management)

### `helldiver_agent.py` (38,109 bytes)
- Very old version of the research agent (before main.py existed)
- Used direct batch API calls without session management
- **Replaced by**: Current main.py architecture

### `setup_neo4j.cypher` (968 bytes)
- Manual Neo4j index creation script
- **Replaced by**: `graph/client.py` builds indexes automatically on first connection

### `test_refactor.py` (2,870 bytes)
- Test script for validating the refactored module structure
- **No longer needed**: Refactoring complete, modules working in production

## Why These Were Archived

All functionality from these files has been migrated to the new modular architecture:

- **main.py** (440 lines) - Entry point, tasking/refinement conversations
- **core/session.py** - Session state management
- **core/research_cycle.py** - Unified research execution
- **workers/research.py** - Batch API for 3 workers + critical analyst
- **graph/client.py** - Graph commits with connection handling
- **utils/files.py** - File I/O and conversation distillation

## When to Reference These Files

Keep these archived files for:
- Debugging if issues arise from the refactoring
- Comparing old vs new implementations
- Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- Historical reference for how problems were solved

## Migration Summary

- **56% line reduction** in main entry point
- **All prompts preserved** (behavior unchanged)
- **All bugs fixed** (episode naming, conversation history, batch API)
- **Better organization** (concerns properly separated)
- **Easier maintenance** (each module has one clear purpose)
