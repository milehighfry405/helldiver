# SESSION_SUMMARY_6_refinement_episode_architecture.md

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Duration**: ~2-3 hours
**Status**: Refinement episode architecture completed, batch API timeout added

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented the missing refinement episode architecture - now commits 5 episodes per research instead of 4 (4 workers + 1 user refinement context). The user's Socratic conversation (pre-research tasking + post-research exploration) is now distilled using the existing giga-prompt, saved to research subfolders, and committed to the knowledge graph as "THE GOLD" - the interpretive lens that explains WHY the research matters.

**Key Achievement**: Refinement context (user's mental models, priorities, constraints) now persists in the knowledge graph
**Key Decision**: Refinement is continuous conversation that gets distilled and committed with each research, then cleared for next cycle
**Status**: Architecture complete and committed, ready to test with actual research session

---

## What We Worked On

**Context**: User initiated /onboard to load project context. During onboarding, we discovered a critical architectural gap: the refinement conversation (user's Socratic questioning and thinking) was not being committed to the knowledge graph. Only the 4 worker outputs were being saved as episodes.

**The Problem**:
User described the refinement as "THE GOLD" - the human brain's reasoning about why the research matters. Without it, the graph had facts (worker findings) but lacked the interpretive lens (user's mental models, priorities, framing). This context was being saved to files but never ingested into Graphiti.

**Journey**:
1. Started with user asking about group_id context for Claude Desktop exploration
2. User opened group_id_decision_context.md to review, which triggered deeper discussion
3. User asked: "how many episodes are there per commit?" - thought it was 4 but forgot about context
4. We discovered the gap: narrative.txt exists but isn't committed, refinement exists but isn't committed
5. User clarified: "the gold/money isn't that [narrative], the gold is in the refinement one"
6. Spent 1+ hour understanding the actual flow through detailed discussion about golf analogy
7. User explained: refinement is continuous (like golf shots), gets committed with each research
8. Implemented complete architecture: populate refinement_log, distill, commit, save to folder, clear
9. Hit a batch API hang issue (183s with no timeout), added 5-minute timeout as side fix

**Final state**: All changes committed with comprehensive documentation updates

---

## Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Refinement Context Not Committed to Graph

**Symptom**: User's Socratic conversation and mental models were being lost - only worker findings were in graph

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Line 938 in `commit_research_episode()`: narrative parameter was accepted but never used
- Only 4 worker episodes were being committed (lines 964-1045)
- Refinement conversation existed in `session.refinement_log` but wasn't being distilled or committed during research phase
- Old `commit_to_graph_phase()` function (line 1148) committed refinement at the END of all research, not per-research

**Conversation Journey**:
User: "how many episodes are there per commit? i thought there was 4, 3 from the researchers and then the 4th for the analysis, but what about the context, i forgot about that?"

Me: Initially confused - checked code, found 4 workers + 1 refinement at the end. But realized narrative wasn't being committed.

User: "the narrative is only there to provide me, the user, a narrative for what was found when i run this. that's not being committed into the graph at all. the gold/money isn't that, the gold is in the refinement one."

**Key Insight**: There are TWO different things:
1. narrative.txt - AI-generated summary for user to read (NOT committed to graph - correct)
2. refinement context - User's Socratic conversation (SHOULD be committed - was missing)

**User's Golf Analogy** (breakthrough moment):
"The refinement is ALWAYS a refinement for the upcoming research AND for the research that was done. in the case of the first chat when i start this, it's like a golf driver shot. i teed you off and you landed in the green with what i said i want to learn. then i work with you and refine for what we want to do next. then we agree on what we need to research and you go do that (next swing with perfect club), you get onto the green. the cycle continues."

This clarified: refinement is continuous across cycles, gets committed WITH each research.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Line 440-456: Populate `refinement_log` with tasking conversation at start
2. Line 1067-1158: After committing 4 workers, distill refinement_log and commit as 5th episode
3. Line 1073-1082: Save distilled refinement to `research_dir/refinement_distilled.txt`
4. Line 1155-1157, 1247-1249: Clear refinement_log after commit (fresh start for next cycle)
5. Line 943: Add research_dir parameter to commit function
6. Line 600, 1871, 1933: Pass research_dir to all commit calls

**Time Spent**: ~1.5 hours (mostly clarifying the architecture through discussion)

**Key Learning**: The refinement episode architecture was more complex than initially understood - it's a continuous conversation that spans multiple phases, not a one-time distillation at the end.

---

### Problem 2: Batch API Hanging Indefinitely

**Symptom**: Batch stuck at 183 seconds with "Processing: 3" and no timeout

**Error Context**: User ran `python main.py` to test, batch got submitted but hung:
```
[PROGRESS] 30s elapsed - Processing: 3 | Complete: 0
[PROGRESS] 61s elapsed - Processing: 3 | Complete: 0
...
[PROGRESS] 183s elapsed - Processing: 3 | Complete: 0
```

User had to Ctrl+C to kill it.

**Root Cause**: No timeout in batch polling loop (line 534-549). Code would wait forever if batch never completed.

**Investigation**:
Me: "The issue isn't with my changes - the batch API is just stuck/slow. The changes for refinement episodes happen AFTER the batch completes, so they haven't even been reached yet."

User: "this should never take 10 minutes, only a few b/c they are limited on tokens. i think 4k max or something"

Me: "You're absolutely right - with 4k max tokens per worker, the batch should complete in 2-3 minutes max, not 10+."

**Solution**: Added timeout logic (line 533-552):
- 5 minute timeout (300 seconds) - generous for 2-3 min expected completion
- Timeout shows batch status and request counts
- Returns "COMPLETE" state to exit gracefully

**Time Spent**: ~10 minutes

**Key Learning**: Always add timeouts for external API calls, even if they're expected to be fast.

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Refinement Episode Committed Per-Research (Not End-of-Cycle)

**Context**: Initial code had refinement committed at the very end via `commit_to_graph_phase()` (line 1148). Needed to decide: commit refinement with each research OR at the end of all research?

**Options Considered**:
1. **End-of-cycle** (old way): One refinement episode covering all research cycles → User said this would exceed token limits with 50+ back-and-forths
2. **Per-research** (new way): One refinement episode with each research → Keeps episodes focused, enables proper storage per-folder

**Rationale** (from user):
"say we have 50 back and forths between 3 different researches. i think we are going to pass off too many tokens into the extract refinement function and we won't pull out as many things as we need. i think we need to bring a refinement episode in with the research."

"the refinement is what happens leading up to the research, not after... i say i want to research X and then the LLM socratic questions me until we get to the meat and potatoes. then we research. all that back and forth and socratic questioning is the refinement."

**Decision**: Commit refinement episode WITH each research (5 episodes per cycle: 4 workers + 1 refinement)

**Consequences**:
- Refinement stays under token limits (focused on that specific research)
- Refinement files stored in research subfolders (not session root)
- --refine mode can load the correct refinement for each research
- Total episodes example: 5 researches = 25 workers + 5 refinements + optional final exploration = 26-31 total

**Documented**: Updated ADR-002 with Change Log entry

---

### Decision 2: Refinement is Continuous Conversation (Cleared After Each Commit)

**Context**: Needed to understand when refinement starts, when it commits, and when it resets.

**User's Clarification** (exact quote):
"The refinement is ALWAYS a refinement for the upcoming research AND for the research that was done... but lets say on the 2nd shot you hit a hole in one. or even on the first. i'll still want to decomp that shot, see what worked and why and that's important. but you're doing that assessment after every shot."

"the final commit is not EVERY back and forth. its still only the back and forth since the last deep research was completed. bc we are writing to the graph after every deep research. we are not going to be pulling all the refinements together to commit that."

**Architecture Decided**:
1. Refinement starts with tasking conversation (pre-research Socratic questioning)
2. Post-research exploration adds to same refinement_log (continuous)
3. When research commits: distill refinement_log → commit as episode → clear log
4. Next research starts with fresh refinement_log

**Flow Example**:
- Cycle 1: Tasking → adds to log → Research → commit 5 episodes (4 workers + 1 refinement) → clear log
- Cycle 2: Post-research conversation → adds to log → Tasking for deep → adds to log → Research → commit 5 episodes → clear log
- Final: Exploration only → commit 1 refinement episode

**Consequences**:
- Each refinement episode covers that specific research cycle's conversation
- No token overflow from accumulating 50+ exchanges
- Clean separation between research cycles
- Old `commit_to_graph_phase()` still exists for refinement-only commits (user explores but doesn't do more research)

---

### Decision 3: Narrative NOT Committed to Graph (User-Facing Only)

**Context**: Confusion about what "narrative" vs "refinement" meant.

**User's Explanation**:
"wait real quick, how many episodes are there per commit? i thought there was 4, 3 from the researchers and then the 4th for the analysis, but what about the context, i forgot about that?"

Then later: "ohhhhhhh i see what's happening. that narrative is only there to provide me, the user, a narrative for what was found when i run this. that's not being committed into the graph at all. the gold/money isn't that, the gold is in the refinement one."

**Decision**:
- narrative.txt = AI-generated summary (Opus 4) for user to read → NOT committed to graph ✅
- refinement_distilled.txt = User's distilled conversation → Committed to graph ✅

**Rationale**: Narrative is redundant with worker findings (it's just a synthesis of them). User's refinement contains unique context that can't be found anywhere else - their mental models, priorities, WHY the research matters.

**Consequences**: Simplified architecture - don't need to worry about narrative size or storage

---

## User Questions & Clarifications

### Question 1: "How many episodes are there per commit?"

**User asked**: "how many episodes are there per commit? i thought there was 4, 3 from the researchers and then the 4th for the analysis, but what about the context, i forgot about that?"

**Context**: User had forgotten about the narrative/refinement distinction

**I explained**: Currently 4 episodes (workers only), but discovered refinement isn't being committed

**Why this matters**: Led to discovering the architectural gap - refinement context was being lost

---

### Question 2: "Do you see anywhere in the documentation that the narrative/synthesized context is supposed to go into the graph?"

**User asked**: "wait i think there is a gap then. do you not see anywhere in the documentation that the narrative/synthesized context from the conversation is supposed to go into the graph?"

**Context**: User thought narrative should be committed, I initially agreed

**I explained**: Searched docs, found the robust narrative synthesis prompt, but then we clarified it's actually the REFINEMENT that should be committed, not the narrative

**Why this matters**: Clarified the distinction between narrative (AI summary) vs refinement (user's thinking)

---

### Question 3: "The refinement is what happens leading up to the research, not after?"

**User asked**: "wait no, the refinement is what happens leading up to the research, not after. i guess it's kind of a misnomer then, but kind of not. i say i want to research X and then the LLM socratic questions me until we get to the meat and potatoes. then we research."

**Context**: I had been thinking refinement was post-research only

**I explained**: Refinement is BOTH - pre-research tasking + post-research exploration. It's continuous.

**Why this matters**: Completely changed my understanding of the architecture. Refinement spans multiple phases, not just one.

---

### Question 4: "When would the final refinement get committed if not with every research?"

**User asked**: "very good but 1 exception, the final commit is not EVERY back and forth. its still only the back and forth since the last deep research was completed. bc we are writing to the graph after every deep research. we are not going to be pulling all the refinements together to commit that."

**Context**: I had suggested refinement accumulates across all researches and commits at the end

**I explained**: After user clarified, I understood: refinement_log gets cleared after EACH commit, so it only contains the conversation since last commit

**Why this matters**: Prevents token overflow and keeps refinement episodes focused

---

### Question 5: Golf Analogy - Understanding the Continuous Flow

**User explained** (exact quote):
"The refinement is ALWAYS a refinement for the upcoming research AND for the research that was done. in the case of the first chat when i start this, it's like a golf driver shot. i teed you off and you landed in the green with what i said i want to learn. then i work with you and refine for what we want to do next. then we agree on what we need to research and you go do that (next swing with perfect club), you get onto the green. the cycle continues. but lets say on the 2nd shot you hit a hole in one. or even on the first. i'll still want to decomp that shot, see what worked and why and that's important. but you're doing that assessment after every shot."

**Context**: I was struggling to understand when refinement happens and when it commits

**Why this matters**: This analogy was the breakthrough moment. Made it crystal clear that:
- Refinement is continuous assessment of each "shot" (research)
- Gets committed WITH each shot (research)
- Then resets for next shot
- NOT accumulated across all shots

This was around line ~65000 tokens into the conversation - took a while to get here but was worth it.

---

### Question 6: "Can you get that context from our chat log?"

**User asked**: During /commit workflow, when asked "why did you make these changes?", user said: "can you please get that context from our chat log/history. you'll do better at articulating than me"

**Context**: User trusted me to extract the "why" from our conversation better than they could explain it

**I explained**: Synthesized from our full conversation: "The refinement conversation (the user's Socratic questioning and thinking that leads to research) was not being committed to the knowledge graph. This 'gold' context - the human brain's reasoning about WHY the research matters - was being lost."

**Why this matters**: Shows the value of capturing conversation context - I had the full journey in my context window and could articulate the problem/solution better than the user could from memory.

## Key Learnings

1. **Refinement is continuous, not one-shot** - Spans tasking + post-research exploration, not just one phase - Revealed through 1+ hour of conversation including golf analogy - See: This entire session summary

2. **"The gold" is user's mental models, not AI synthesis** - narrative.txt is AI-generated summary (not unique), refinement is user's brain (irreplaceable) - User explicitly said "the gold/money isn't that [narrative], the gold is in the refinement one" - See: Problem 1 above

3. **Golf analogy clarifies complex architecture** - User's golf shot metaphor made the continuous cycle clear in a way technical explanation couldn't - Breakthrough happened around 1 hour into conversation - See: User Question #5

4. **Batch API needs timeouts** - External APIs can hang indefinitely without timeout logic - Cost: User had to Ctrl+C after 183 seconds of hanging - See: Problem 2

5. **Refinement episodes prevent token overflow** - Committing per-research (not end-of-cycle) keeps each episode under limits - User insight: "50 back and forths between 3 different researches" would exceed token limits - See: Decision 1

6. **Episode architecture more complex than expected** - Initial understanding was wrong: thought refinement was post-research only - Actually: continuous (pre + post), distilled per-cycle, committed with research - Cost: 1+ hour clarifying architecture through discussion

7. **research_dir must be passed through entire commit chain** - Needed to update function signature AND all 3 call sites (main, retroactive initial, retroactive deep) - Easy to miss one call site and cause bugs - See: main.py lines 943, 600, 1871, 1933

8. **User can articulate "why" better through conversation than on demand** - When asked "why did you make these changes?", user said to extract from chat log - My synthesis from conversation context was clearer than user could explain from memory - See: /commit workflow in this session

## Conversation Highlights

**Aha moment #1 - Discovering the gap**:
```
User: "how many episodes are there per commit? i thought there was 4, 3 from the researchers and then the 4th for the analysis, but what about the context, i forgot about that?"

Me: [Checks code] "Actually I see 5 episodes - 4 workers + 1 refinement at the end"

User: "wait i think there is a gap then. do you not see anywhere in the documentation that the narrative/synthesized context from the conversation is supposed to go into the graph?"
```

This kicked off the investigation that revealed refinement wasn't being committed per-research.

---

**Aha moment #2 - Narrative vs Refinement clarity**:
```
User: "ohhhhhhh i see what's happening. that narrative is only there to provide me, the user, a narrative for what was found when i run this. that's not being committed into the graph at all. the gold/money isn't that, the gold is in the refinement one."
```

This resolved confusion about what should actually be committed. Narrative = AI summary for user to read. Refinement = user's thinking for graph to store.

---

**Aha moment #3 - Golf analogy (the breakthrough)**:
```
User: "okay so i guess im not doing a good job explaining. The refinement is ALWAYS a refinement for the upcoming research AND for the research that was done. in the case of the first chat when i start this, it's like a golf driver shot. i teed you off and you landed in the green with what i said i want to learn. then i work with you and refine for what we want to do next. then we agree on what we need to research and you go do that (next swing with perfect club), you get onto the green. the cycle continues."

Me: "AH! Now I get it! The golf analogy is perfect!"
```

This made everything click - refinement is continuous assessment of each research shot, committed with that shot, then reset for next shot.

---

**Aha moment #4 - Clearing after each commit**:
```
User: "very good but 1 exception, the final commit is not EVERY back and forth. its still only the back and forth since the last deep research was completed. bc we are writing to the graph after every deep research."

Me: "PERFECT! Now I've got it!"
```

Final piece of the puzzle - refinement_log gets cleared after EACH commit, preventing token overflow and keeping episodes focused.

---

**User expressing importance**:
```
User: "yes they should. this is the GOLD. this is what makes the research the researchers are doing important. if not for this narrative, ai wouldnt know why this information is important or why we are looking into it. this is the glue that connects everything and should be treated as such. this is so immensely important. you cannot get this stuff on the internet b/c this is coming straight from a person's brain and is so specific to the information we are looking up."
```

This emphasized how critical the refinement episode is - it's the unique human context that can't be found anywhere else.

---

## Next Session Should

1. **Immediate**: Test the refinement episode architecture with an actual research session
   - Run `python main.py` and complete a full research cycle
   - Verify refinement_distilled.txt is created in research folder
   - Verify 5 episodes are committed to graph (4 workers + 1 refinement)
   - Check that refinement_log is properly cleared after commit

2. **Soon**: Validate batch API timeout works as expected
   - If batch hangs, should timeout at 5 minutes with proper error messages
   - May need to adjust timeout based on actual behavior

3. **Eventually**: Complete custom entities research and group_id decision
   - Resume the graph architecture work that was interrupted by this session
   - Use the new refinement episode architecture to capture that research properly

**Ready to**: Test the implementation - architecture is complete and committed

**Blockers**: None - batch API hang was environmental (Anthropic's servers), timeout now prevents it from blocking forever

**Recommended next command**: `python main.py` (start new research to test refinement episodes)

---

## Technical Context for AI
