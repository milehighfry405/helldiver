# Session Summary: Helldiver Research Agent Development

This session is being continued from a previous conversation. The conversation is summarized below:

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user is continuing development of the Helldiver Research Agent with the following explicit requests:

1. **Fix query extraction bug in retroactive migration** - Old sessions had their original query overwritten by deep research queries, causing episode names to show verbose metadata instead of clean original queries
2. **Validate multi-episode graph commit in mock mode** - Test that retroactive commits work correctly before going live with real Graphiti
3. **Set up GitHub repo for computer migration** - Push project to GitHub with proper .gitignore (exclude API keys, include migration session), enable seamless continuation on new computer
4. **Generate full session summary** - Create comprehensive continuation document like Claude Code generates when approaching context limits

The user's ultimate goal: Commit all research (initial + deep + refinement) to Graphiti knowledge graph, then use graph to build Clay tables for Arthur AI lead generation.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

### Multi-Episode Graph Architecture
Breaking large research into focused episodes for better Graphiti entity extraction:
- **Episode 1:** Initial research (written when research completes)
- **Episodes 2+:** Each deep research session (written when completed)
- **Final episode:** Refined understanding (written at commit, links to all research)

### Graph-Aware Distillation
Distillation prompt rebuilt following Anthropic best practices to optimize for entity extraction:
- XML tags for structure (`<task>`, `<instructions>`, `<output_format>`)
- Entity-rich sentences with clear subject-verb-object structure
- Relational language (is, has, requires, connects to)
- Explicit entity section to aid graph node creation

### Session State Management
- `session.query` - Current query (gets overwritten by deep research)
- `session.original_query` - Original query (never overwritten) ← **NEW**
- `session.initial_episode_id` - ID of initial research episode
- `session.deep_episode_ids` - List of deep research episode IDs

### Retroactive Migration
System to detect and commit old research from before multi-episode feature:
- Loads narrative, worker results, critical analysis from files
- Prompts user for original query (when lost due to deep research overwrite)
- Prompts user for clean deep research topic names (when verbose)
- Commits episodes with correct metadata and parent linking

### Mock Mode Validation
Testing graph writes without actually committing to Graphiti:
- Simulates what would be written
- Reveals bugs in query/topic extraction
- Validates episode structure before going live

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `main.py` - Core agent logic

**ResearchSession.__init__ (line 48)**
```python
self.original_query = None  # Store original query separately (never overwritten)
```
NEW field to preserve original query when deep research overwrites `session.query`

**tasking_conversation (line 142)**
```python
session.query = query
session.original_query = query  # Store original query (never overwritten)
```
Set both query fields during initial tasking

**save_metadata (lines 67-76)**
```python
json.dump({
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "state": self.state,
    "query": self.query,
    "original_query": self.original_query,  # NEW
    "deep_research_count": self.deep_research_count,
    "initial_episode_id": self.initial_episode_id,  # NEW
    "deep_episode_ids": self.deep_episode_ids  # NEW
}, f, indent=2)
```
Persist original_query and episode IDs to session.json

**load_existing_session (lines 1232-1238)**
```python
session.query = metadata.get('query', '')
session.original_query = metadata.get('original_query', metadata.get('query', ''))
session.deep_research_count = metadata.get('deep_research_count', 0)
session.initial_episode_id = metadata.get('initial_episode_id', '')
session.deep_episode_ids = metadata.get('deep_episode_ids', [])
```
Load original_query with fallback to current query for backward compatibility

**commit_research_episode (lines 650-706)**
```python
async def commit_research_episode(
    session: ResearchSession,
    research_type: str,  # "initial" or "deep"
    narrative: str,
    worker_results: dict,
    critical_analysis: str,
    parent_episode_id: str = None
) -> dict:
```
Commits focused research episode to graph with parent linking

**retroactive_commit_research (lines 1309-1420)**
```python
async def retroactive_commit_research(session: ResearchSession, session_dir: str):
    """Retroactively commit research episodes from old session"""
```

**CRITICAL SECTION - Original query prompt (lines 1338-1358)**
```python
# Use original_query field (not current query which may be overwritten by deep research)
# For old sessions without original_query, try to infer or prompt
if not session.original_query or session.original_query == session.query:
    # Query was lost - try to infer from narrative or prompt user
    print("\n" + "="*80)
    print("MIGRATION NOTE: Original research query not found in session metadata.")
    print("This happens with old sessions from before the multi-episode feature.")
    print("="*80)
    print(f"\nCurrent query in session: {session.query[:200]}...")
    print("\nThis looks like a deep research query (verbose/structured).")
    user_original = input("\nWhat was the ORIGINAL research query? (e.g., 'arthur ai based on out nyc'): ").strip()
    if user_original:
        session.original_query = user_original
        print(f"[MIGRATION] Using original query: {user_original}")
    else:
        print("[MIGRATION] No original query provided, using current query")
        session.original_query = session.query

# Temporarily set correct query for episode commit
old_query = session.query
session.query = session.original_query
```
Prompts user for original query during migration when it was lost

**CRITICAL SECTION - Deep research topic cleanup (lines 1395-1416)**
```python
# Extract topic from directory name and clean it up
raw_topic = deep_dirs[0].replace(f"deep_research_{i}_", "").replace("_", " ")

# Check if topic looks like extraction metadata rather than clean topic
topic = raw_topic
looks_verbose = (
    len(raw_topic.split()) > 8 or
    "based on" in raw_topic.lower() or
    "they want" in raw_topic.lower() or
    "conversation" in raw_topic.lower()
)

if looks_verbose:
    # For migration: prompt user for clean topic
    print(f"\n[MIGRATION] Deep research {i} has verbose topic: '{raw_topic[:80]}...'")
    clean_topic = input("Enter a clean topic name (e.g., 'ICP signals for downmarket'): ").strip()
    if clean_topic:
        topic = clean_topic
        print(f"[MIGRATION] Using clean topic: {topic}")

old_query = session.query
session.query = topic
```
Detects verbose deep research topics and prompts user for clean names

**Graph-aware distillation prompt (lines 929-991)**
```python
distillation_prompt = f"""<task>
Extract the essential signal from a conversational refinement session and prepare it for knowledge graph ingestion.

This output will be written to a knowledge graph (Graphiti/Neo4j) that:
- Extracts entities from sentences (people, companies, concepts, tools)
- Identifies relationships between entities (is, has, requires, enables, connects to)
- Links this context to research findings to form a coherent knowledge structure

Your goal: Create clear, entity-rich sentences that enable strong graph connections.
</task>

<instructions>
CRITICAL for knowledge graph optimization:
- Use explicit entity names (e.g., "Arthur AI" not "they", "Clay enrichment system" not "it")
- Write complete sentences with clear subject-verb-object structure
- Use relational language (is, has, requires, connects to, enables, influences)
- Connect the user's mental models to research concepts explicitly
- Be specific about tools, companies, methodologies, frameworks mentioned
</instructions>

<output_format>
## Key Entities
[List the main entities mentioned: companies, tools, methodologies, roles, concepts. This helps the graph create strong entity nodes.]

## Core Mental Models
[User's key insights and frameworks in entity-rich sentences]

## Relationships to Research
[How user's context connects to research findings, using explicit entity names]
</output_format>
```

### `graphiti_client.py` - Knowledge graph interface

**commit_episode (lines 59-86)**
```python
# Extract key information from tasking context
refinement_turns = tasking_context.get('refinement_turns', 0)  # COUNT ONLY
summary = tasking_context.get('summary', 'No specific tasking details')
weighting = tasking_context.get('weighting', '')

# Construct episodic narrative for Graphiti
episode_body = f"""User researched: {original_query}

Context: {user_context if user_context else 'General research'}

Tasking details: {summary}

Key findings:
{findings_narrative}

Evolution: User conducted research, """

# Add refinement evolution if applicable
if refinement_turns > 0:
    episode_body += f"refined understanding through {refinement_turns} conversation turns, "

if weighting:
    episode_body += f"with {weighting} applied to synthesis, "

episode_body += f"and concluded that {key_takeaway}."
```
CHANGED: Only includes turn count, not raw chat logs (removed noise)

### `.gitignore` - Version control exclusions

```
Excludes API keys, includes migration session for one-time transfer

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Raw chat logs going to graph
**Error:** `tasking_context['refinements']` was sending list of all raw user inputs:
```python
"refinements": [turn['user_input'] for turn in session.refinement_log]
```
Created noise like: "refined focus to do you have access to files?, okay well based on..."

**Fix:** Changed to send only count (line 679 in main.py):
```python
"refinement_turns": len(session.refinement_log),  # Count only, not raw text
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Error 2: Distillation prompt over-fitted to specific use case
**Error:** Original distillation prompt had domain-specific examples about Arthur AI GTM

**Fix:** Rebuilt prompt following Anthropic docs with:
- Generic examples (ML monitoring, SaaS pricing)
- XML tags for structure
- Graph optimization guidance
- Entity-focused output format

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Error 3: Query extraction bug in retroactive commit
**Error:** When loading existing session with `--refine`, mock output showed:
```
Episode Name: Research: Based on the conversation, they want deep research
```
Using deep research query instead of original "arthur ai based on out nyc" query.

**Root cause:** `session.query` gets overwritten during deep research. When session is saved/reloaded, `session.json` only contains the last query value.

**Fix:**
1. Added `session.original_query` field (line 48)
2. Set it during initial tasking (line 142)
3. Persist to session.json (line 72)
4. Load from metadata with fallback (line 1234)
5. For old sessions without it, prompt user during migration (lines 1338-1358)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - prompts user for original query during migration

### Error 4: Deep research topic extraction too verbose
**Error:** Mock output showed deep research episode named:
```
Research: Based on the conversation, they want deep research
```
Instead of clean topic like "ICP signals for downmarket"

**Root cause:** Directory name `deep_research_1_Based_on_the_conversation,_they_want_deep_research` contains verbose extraction metadata, not clean topic

**Fix:**
1. Detect verbose topics using heuristics (lines 1400-1405):
   - More than 8 words
   - Contains "based on", "they want", "conversation"
2. Prompt user for clean topic name (lines 1407-1413)

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED - Detection logic added, needs testing

## 5. Testing Status

### Last Test Run (from user's terminal output):

**Command:**
```bash
python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Migration detected successfully
- ✅ Prompted for original query
- ✅ User entered: "arthur ai based on out nyc"
- ✅ Initial episode correct: `"Research: arthur ai based on out nyc"`
- ❌ Deep research prompt did NOT appear
- ❌ Deep episode still wrong: `"Research: Based on the conversation, they want deep research"`

**Issue:** The verbose topic detection should trigger prompt but isn't showing. Need to verify:
1. Is `raw_topic` being extracted correctly?
2. Is `looks_verbose` evaluating to True?
3. Is the input prompt executing?

### Expected Behavior:
1. Load session
2. Detect migration needed
3. **Prompt 1:** "What was the ORIGINAL research query?" → User enters: `arthur ai based on out nyc`
4. Commit initial episode: `"Research: arthur ai based on out nyc"` ✅
5. **Prompt 2:** "Enter a clean topic name" → User enters: `ICP signals for downmarket`
6. Commit deep episode: `"Research: ICP signals for downmarket"` ❌ NOT HAPPENING

## 6. User Context and Goal

### User's Background:
- Building lead generation system in Clay for Arthur AI
- Brother is CTO at Arthur AI
- Arthur has strong enterprise product but missing downmarket GTM
- User wants to prove there's a reachable Series B-D market Arthur is ignoring

### User's Workflow:
1. Run research sessions on various topics
2. Commit all findings to Graphiti knowledge graph
3. Query graph to build Clay tables with:
   - ICP signals
   - Fit scores
   - Contact personas
   - Messaging hooks
4. Hand off qualified leads to Arthur's AE (who already wants them)

### Current Session:
- **Original query:** "arthur ai based on out nyc"
- **Initial research:** Completed (Arthur AI product analysis, competitive landscape, market opportunity)
- **Deep research:** Completed (ICP signals for downmarket - company characteristics, behavioral signals, technographic indicators)
- **Refinement:** 21 conversation turns refining understanding of GTM opportunity
- **Status:** Ready to commit to graph, but validating in mock mode first

### Why This Session Matters:
This is the first session being migrated with the new multi-episode feature. Getting it right validates:
- Retroactive migration works correctly
- Episode names are clean and meaningful
- Parent linking between episodes functions
- Distilled context is properly graph-optimized

Once this works, user can commit future sessions automatically without manual intervention.

## 7. All User Messages (Key Ones)

1. **Initial confusion about mock output:**
"okay good?" (after seeing wrong episode names)

2. **Questioning if it's hardcoded:**
"i want to ensure that what im seeing also isn't hard coded or something. we are using real data in this. like if we just init a new agent and never stopped, it would be like that?"

3. **Showing test results:**
[Provided terminal output showing migration prompt worked for original query, but deep research topic still wrong]

4. **Asking about test results:**
"how about now"

5. **Computer migration request:**
"okay can you please do 3 things for me:
1. can we link this to github. i want to move computers. i want to ensure that no api keys or shit make it up. i want to include the research files this time, but not normally b/c i want to continue this arch to get this shit into the graph..."
2. can you output this chat, like you do when you run out of context, you give a perfect prompt for the next claude chat..."
3. can you ensure that we have all the right files, no more, no less or something..."

6. **Clarifying continuation doc:**
"the continue session.md is not what im talking about. when you (claude code) run out of context or approach it here, you output a masssssssive file that details everything. its quite long/robust."

## 8. Pending Tasks

1. **Debug deep research topic prompt** - Why isn't the second prompt showing during migration?
   - Add debug prints to verify `raw_topic` value
   - Verify `looks_verbose` condition evaluates correctly
   - Test prompt execution

2. **Validate complete migration flow** - Run full test with both prompts working:
   - Original query prompt ✅
   - Deep research topic prompt ⚠️ (not showing)

3. **Install graphiti_core and commit to real graph** - After validation passes

4. **Future research sessions** - Once migration works, proceed with additional research for Clay table building

## 9. Current Work State

### Just Completed:
1. ✅ Added `original_query` field to ResearchSession
2. ✅ Updated save/load to persist original_query and episode IDs
3. ✅ Built migration prompt for original query (working)
4. ✅ Built migration prompt for deep research topics (not working yet)
5. ✅ Set up GitHub repo: https://github.com/milehighfry405/helldiver.git
6. ✅ Created proper .gitignore (excludes .env, includes migration session)
7. ✅ Pushed all code to GitHub
8. ✅ Generated this full session summary

### Currently Blocked On:
**Deep research topic prompt not showing during migration**

The detection logic at [main.py:1400-1405](main.py#L1400-L1405) should trigger when `raw_topic` = "Based on the conversation, they want deep research" (9 words, contains "based on", "conversation", "they want").

Need to debug why prompt isn't executing.

### Next Action:
Add debug logging to retroactive commit to trace:
1. What is `deep_dirs[0]`?
2. What is `raw_topic` after processing?
3. Does `looks_verbose` evaluate to True?
4. Is the input prompt reached?

## 10. Environment Setup

### Current Computer:
- Python: Global pip (no venv)
- Dependencies: Installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- API Keys: In `.env` file (not in git)
- Graphiti: Mock mode (graphiti_core not installed)

### New Computer Setup:
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/milehighfry405/helldiver.git`
2. Create `.env` with API keys (email from old computer)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Test migration: `python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"`

### Key Files in Repo:
- ✅ All Python code (main.py, graphiti_client.py, helldiver_agent.py)
- ✅ Configuration (requirements.txt, .gitignore, README.md)
- ✅ Migration session (context/session_research_20251012_170404/)
- ✅ Documentation (docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md, SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Utilities (scripts/kill_agents.py)
- ❌ .env file (excluded, must bring separately)
- ❌ venv/ (excluded, user uses global pip)
- ❌ Other sessions (excluded, only migration session included)

## 11. Technical Architecture Summary

### Research Phase:
1. User provides query
2. Socratic questioning refines query
3. Spawn 4 parallel workers (academic, industry, tool, critical)
4. Workers fetch web content via Anthropic Batch API (50% cost savings)
5. Synthesize findings into narrative
6. **NEW:** Commit initial research episode to graph immediately

### Deep Research Phase:
1. User requests deep research on specific topic
2. Extract topic from user input + conversation context
3. Spawn 4 new workers focused on that topic
4. Synthesize deep research findings
5. **NEW:** Commit deep research episode with parent link to initial episode

### Refinement Phase:
1. User asks questions, provides context, refines understanding
2. Each turn logged to refinement_context.json
3. User can request additional deep research (creates new episodes)
4. **NEW:** Distillation extracts mental models in graph-optimized format

### Commit Phase:
1. User says "commit"
2. Distill refinement conversations into graph-optimized context
3. **NEW:** Commit refinement episode with links to all research episodes
4. Episode structure enables graph to connect:
   - User mental models → Research findings
   - Initial research → Deep research topics
   - Questions → Insights → Entities

### Graph Query Phase (Future):
1. Query Graphiti for ICP signals, messaging hooks, buyer personas
2. Use graph insights to build Clay enrichment tables
3. Generate fit scores and contact lists
4. Create messaging sequences and ad copy
5. Hand off to Arthur's sales team

## 12. For the Next Claude Code Session

### Immediate Priority:
**Debug why deep research topic prompt isn't showing during migration.**

### How to Debug:
1. Add print statements in [main.py:1395-1420](main.py#L1395-L1420):
   ```python
   print(f"[DEBUG] deep_dirs[0]: {deep_dirs[0]}")
   print(f"[DEBUG] raw_topic: {raw_topic}")
   print(f"[DEBUG] looks_verbose: {looks_verbose}")
   ```

2. Run migration: `python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"`

3. Check if prompt appears or if condition fails

### Test Criteria:
✅ **Success:** Both prompts show and episode names are clean:
- Initial: `"Research: arthur ai based on out nyc"`
- Deep: `"Research: <whatever user enters>"`

❌ **Failure:** Deep prompt doesn't show, episode name still verbose

### After Fix:
1. Remove debug prints
2. Test full migration flow
3. Commit fixes to GitHub
4. Install graphiti_core
5. Run real graph commit
6. Proceed with additional research sessions

### User's Expectation:
"i literally want to continue this conversation where we left off"

The user wants seamless continuation - pick up debugging the deep research topic prompt and get migration fully working.
