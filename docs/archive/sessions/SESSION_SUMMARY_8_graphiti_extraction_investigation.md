# SESSION_SUMMARY_8_graphiti_extraction_investigation.md

**Date**: 2025-01-24
**Duration**: ~4-5 hours (deep investigation session)
**Status**: Schema implementation paused - needs redesign to align with Graphiti's NER architecture

---

## Executive Summary

Deep investigative session that discovered Graphiti's fundamental architectural constraint: it's designed for Named Entity Recognition (concrete nouns mentioned in text) rather than conceptual entity extraction (abstract information that IS the text structure itself). We successfully implemented infrastructure for custom entity types (entity_types.py, integration with add_episode(), worker prompt enhancements), fixed critical bugs (protected field conflicts, async warnings, group_id strategy), and added tooling (--commit-to-graph flag). However, testing revealed meta-entities (ResearchFinding, StrategicIntent, ExecutionOutcome) don't extract correctly - they create generic Entity nodes instead of typed nodes with attributes.

**Key Achievement**: Complete 8-point investigation of Graphiti's extraction architecture, identifying why conceptual entities fail

**Key Decision**: Pause meta-entity implementation and redesign schema to work WITH Graphiti's NER paradigm (use only concrete entity types)

**Status**: Code is functional for concrete entities (Company, Tool, Methodology). Ready for schema redesign.

---

## What We Worked On

**Context**: User wanted to implement custom entity types for Graphiti to capture research intelligence in structured form - not just concrete entities (companies, tools) but also research findings, strategic intent, and execution outcomes. The goal was to enable execution agents to query specific types of knowledge (e.g., "show me workflow_guide findings about Clay").

**Journey**:

### Phase 1: Schema Implementation (First 2 Hours)

Started with implementing schema v2 based on user's design document:
- Created `graph/entity_types.py` with 6 entity types (3 meta, 3 domain)
- Added `entity_types=RESEARCH_ENTITY_TYPES` to all `add_episode()` calls
- Enhanced worker prompts with execution formatting hints (5th guideline)
- Fixed protected field issues (`name` → `company_name`, `tool_name`, `methodology_name`)

**First attempt**: User ran research, got protected field errors:
```
Failed to commit: name cannot be used as an attribute for Company as it is a protected attribute name
```

Fixed by renaming fields to avoid Graphiti's reserved `name` field.

### Phase 2: Testing and Discovery (Hour 3)

**Second attempt**: User ran `--commit-to-graph` to retroactively commit research.

Discovered: Company and Tool entities extracted successfully ✅, but ResearchFinding entities showed as generic `Entity` nodes ❌.

User's observation: "10 generic Entity nodes, but no ResearchFinding labels"

This triggered the investigation - why do concrete entities work but conceptual ones don't?

### Phase 3: Deep Investigation (Hours 3-5)

User asked for comprehensive investigation with specific questions:
1. How does add_episode() actually work?
2. Does custom_prompt parameter exist?
3. Can we filter entity_types per episode?
4. Multiple add_episode() calls on same content?
5. Token usage analysis
6. Extraction quality issues
7. Performance impact
8. Architecture recommendation

I traced through Graphiti's source code (graphiti_core package) and discovered the fundamental mismatch:

**The "Aha" Moment**:
Graphiti's extraction uses this prompt:
```
"Extract entities from the TEXT that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned."
```

This is Named Entity Recognition - looking for proper nouns.
- "Arthur.ai" → Company ✅
- "Clay" → Tool ✅
- "Key finding: Arthur has three pricing tiers" → Sees "Arthur" (Company), but doesn't recognize the paragraph as a ResearchFinding entity ❌

**Two-stage extraction problem**:
1. Stage 1: Extract entity **names** ("Arthur.ai", "Clay")
2. Stage 2: For each named entity, extract attributes

ResearchFinding has no "name" mentioned in text - it IS the text structure itself. No name to extract → can't create entity → fails.

### Phase 4: Solution Exploration

Explored 4 potential solutions:
1. **Fork Graphiti** - Modify extraction prompts (complex, risky - deduplication issues)
2. **Hybrid JSON** - Append extracted findings as JSON to episode_body (no fork needed!)
3. **Dual storage** - Graphiti for concrete, separate system for conceptual (cleanest separation)
4. **Custom extractors** - Checked source, not supported by Graphiti

**User's decision**: "I personally think it's just going to be redoing the schema knowing ahead of time that we can only use entities. Then it should be a relatively quick fix after I work out what the schema is going to be."

**Outcome**: Pause implementation, redesign schema to use only concrete entity types that work with Graphiti's NER architecture.

## Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Protected Field Name Conflicts

**Symptom**: All 5 episode commits failed with same error
```
[ERROR] Failed to commit: name cannot be used as an attribute for Company as it is a protected attribute name.
```

**Root Cause**: Graphiti reserves the `name` field for internal use (entity identification). Our entity definitions used `name` as a custom attribute:
```python
class Company(BaseModel):
    name: str  # ❌ CONFLICT
```

**Investigation**:
- First error appeared during test research commit
- User saw pattern - ALL episodes failed, same error
- I checked Graphiti documentation for protected fields
- Found list: `uuid, name, group_id, labels, created_at, summary, attributes, name_embedding`

**Solution**: Renamed fields to be more specific
- `Company.name` → `Company.company_name`
- `Tool.name` → `Tool.tool_name`
- `Methodology.name` → `Methodology.methodology_name`

**Files changed**:
- `graph/entity_types.py:53,61,68` - Field name changes
- `zz_personal folder/schema.md:42,50,57` - Documentation updates

**Time Spent**: ~20 minutes
**Key Insight**: Always check tool documentation for reserved fields before designing schema

### Problem 2: Async Close() Warning

**Symptom**: Warning appeared during graph reconnection:
```
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Graphiti.close' was never awaited
  self.graphiti.close()
```

**Root Cause**: `graphiti.close()` is an async method, but we were calling it synchronously in `_reconnect()`:
```python
if self.graphiti:
    try:
        self.graphiti.close()  # ❌ Async method called sync
    except:
        pass
```

**Investigation**:
- Warning appeared during connection loss/reconnect cycle
- Checked Graphiti API - `close()` returns a coroutine
- In reconnect flow, we're recreating the connection anyway

**Solution**: Remove the close() call entirely - let garbage collection handle cleanup
```python
# Close old connection (if exists)
# Note: graphiti.close() is async, but we're recreating anyway
# so we just let the old connection get garbage collected
```

**File changed**: `graph/client.py:112-114`

**Time Spent**: ~10 minutes
**Key Insight**: Check async/sync signatures when calling library methods - warnings indicate design mismatch

### Problem 3: ResearchFinding Entities Not Extracting

**Symptom**: After commit, Neo4j showed:
- 3 Company entities with correct labels `["Entity", "Company"]` ✅
- 2 Tool entities with correct labels `["Entity", "Tool"]` ✅
- 10 generic entities with only `["Entity"]` label - no ResearchFinding ❌

**Error Message**: No error - extraction "succeeded" but created wrong node types

**Root Cause**: Fundamental architectural mismatch between our use case and Graphiti's design

**Investigation Journey**:

1. **Initial hypothesis**: "Maybe prompt isn't clear enough?"
   - Checked worker outputs - they had "Key finding:" markers
   - Ruled out: Format was good

2. **Second hypothesis**: "Maybe entity_types not being passed correctly?"
   - Traced code: `RESEARCH_ENTITY_TYPES` dict included ResearchFinding ✅
   - Traced to `add_episode()` call - parameter passed correctly ✅
   - Ruled out: Integration was correct

3. **Third hypothesis**: "Maybe too many required fields?"
   - ResearchFinding has 6 required fields
   - Company has 4 fields (3 optional) - extracts fine
   - Maybe not the issue?

4. **Deep dive into Graphiti source code**:
   - Read `graphiti_core/graphiti.py:730-756` - extraction pipeline
   - Read `graphiti_core/utils/maintenance/node_operations.py:88-199` - extract_nodes()
   - Read `graphiti_core/prompts/extract_nodes.py:169-196` - actual extraction prompt

5. **BREAKTHROUGH** - Found the extraction prompt:
```python
user_prompt = f"""
<ENTITY TYPES>
{context['entity_types']}
</ENTITY TYPES>

<TEXT>
{context['episode_content']}
</TEXT>

Given the above text, extract entities from the TEXT that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned.
```

**Key words**: "explicitly or implicitly **mentioned**"

This is Named Entity Recognition - looking for **nouns**:
- "Arthur.ai" is mentioned ✅
- "Clay" is mentioned ✅
- ResearchFinding is NOT mentioned - it's the **structure** of the text ❌

6. **Two-stage extraction discovery**:

Stage 1 (extract_nodes.py):
```python
class ExtractedEntity(BaseModel):
    name: str  # Entity NAME is required!
    entity_type_id: int
```

Graphiti extracts entity **names** first, then creates nodes:
```python
new_node = EntityNode(
    name=extracted_entity.name,  # Must have a name!
    labels=['Entity', entity_type_name],
)
```

Stage 2 (extract_attributes_from_node):
For each created entity, extract attributes based on entity_type Pydantic model.

**The problem**: ResearchFinding has no "name" in the text. The LLM can't extract a name for something that's not mentioned as a noun.

**Time Spent**: ~2 hours of investigation (tracing source code, reading prompts, testing hypotheses)

**Key Insight**: Tool architecture assumptions matter - we assumed Graphiti could extract "any entity type" but it's specifically designed for NER (named entities), not conceptual entities

**Solution Status**: No immediate fix - requires schema redesign

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Use Single Global group_id

**Context**: Previous schema used hierarchical group_ids: `helldiver_research_{session}_{type}`. This was designed to enable filtering by session or type.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keep hierarchical** - `helldiver_research_Session_initial` → Enables filtering by session, but requires passing all group_ids to MCP queries
2. **Single global** - `helldiver_research` → Enables "omega context" (search across all research), simpler

**User previously asked**: "does it just be test?" (regarding commit-to-graph flag)

This triggered review of group_id strategy based on earlier investigation findings.

**Rationale**:
- Graphiti's group_id is **optional** - default behavior searches entire graph
- Our vision is cross-session synthesis ("omega context")
- MCP doesn't support wildcard filtering - would need to manually pass all group_ids
- Simpler is better - one group for all research

**Chosen**: Option 2 - Single global `"helldiver_research"`

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Pro: Enables cross-session entity synthesis automatically
- ✅ Pro: Simpler queries - no group_id filtering needed
- ⚠️ Neutral: Can still filter by episode name or source_description if needed

**Implementation**:
- `core/research_cycle.py:131-133` - Changed from hierarchical to single global
- Comment explains rationale: "Enables cross-session entity synthesis and 'omega context' search"

**Documented**: Updated CURRENT_WORK.md with decision and rationale

### Decision 2: Add --commit-to-graph Flag

**Context**: During testing, graph commits failed (protected field errors). Research files were saved to disk but never committed to Neo4j. User needed a way to retry commits without re-running research.

**User asked**: "can you please add a flag to the main.py where i can commit the files to the graph? like i pass in the folder where all the files live and it confirms with me and then executes the same functions as would happen in the main app?"

**Options Considered**:
1. **Manual retry** - Delete session, re-run research → Wastes time and API credits
2. **Separate script** - Create standalone commit script → Extra file to maintain
3. **CLI flag** - Add `--commit-to-graph` to main.py → Clean, integrated solution

**Chosen**: Option 3 - CLI flag

**Rationale**:
- Integrated with existing code (uses same `commit_research_episode()` function)
- User-friendly (one command with confirmation)
- Reusable for future failed commits

**Implementation**:
- `main.py:39` - Added argument parser flag
- `main.py:476-581` - Implemented `commit_existing_research_to_graph()` function
- `main.py:681-685` - Added CLI routing logic

**Usage**:
```bash
python main.py --commit-to-graph "context/Session_Name"
```

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Pro: Can retry commits without re-running research
- ✅ Pro: Useful for backfilling graph after wipes
- ✅ Pro: User-friendly confirmation workflow

**Time to implement**: ~30 minutes

### Decision 3: Pause Meta-Entity Implementation

**Context**: After discovering Graphiti's NER architecture, we had to decide: force it to work or redesign?

**User's perspective**: "okay the next thing we are going to be doing is updating our schema...sounds good? im about to run them" (referring to commit plugins)

Then: "okay im doing another deep research right now to iron out the next steps...we are going to need to document those as well"

Finally: "I personally think it's just going to be redoing the schema knowing ahead of time that we can only use entities. Then it should be a relatively quick fix after I work out what the schema is going to be."

**Options Considered**:
1. **Fork Graphiti** - Modify extraction prompts to handle conceptual entities
   - Pros: Could potentially make it work
   - Cons: Complex changes, deduplication risks, maintenance burden
   - Why not: High risk, uncertain outcome

2. **Hybrid JSON approach** - Pre-extract findings with Claude, append as JSON to episode_body
   - Pros: No fork needed, uses proven Claude extraction
   - Cons: Extra LLM call, longer episode content
   - Why not: User preferred simpler schema redesign

3. **Dual storage** - Graphiti for concrete, separate system for findings
   - Pros: Clean separation, full control
   - Cons: Two systems to maintain, findings not in graph
   - Why not: Defeats purpose of unified knowledge graph

4. **Redesign schema** - Use only concrete entity types that work with NER
   - Pros: Works with Graphiti's design, not against it
   - Cons: Need to rethink how to capture research intelligence
   - Why chosen: **Simplest path, aligns with tool capabilities**

**Chosen**: Option 4 - Redesign schema

**Rationale** (user's words): "knowing ahead of time that we can only use entities...should be a relatively quick fix"

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Pro: Work WITH Graphiti's architecture
- ✅ Pro: Simpler implementation (no fork, no hybrid system)
- ⚠️ Neutral: Need to redesign how we capture findings (creative challenge)
- ❌ Con: Current entity_types.py won't work as designed

**Next steps**:
1. User will research/design new schema based on NER constraints
2. Update entity_types.py with concrete-only entities
3. Test extraction
4. Iterate

**Documented**: CURRENT_WORK.md updated with pause status and next steps

## User Questions & Clarifications

### Question 1: Mock Mode Flag

**User asked**: "should it just be test?" (referring to --mock flag that didn't exist)

**Context**: User tried to run:
```bash
python main.py --refine "context/Session" --mock
```

Got error:
```
unrecognized arguments: --mock
```

**I explained**: Current code has `--test` flag (fast research with Haiku), not `--mock`. The old code had `--mock` for simulating graph writes without Neo4j.

**Why this matters**: User was trying to test without hitting Neo4j (sensible for schema testing). The `--test` flag does run research but DOES commit to Neo4j, so it wasn't exactly what they wanted. However, we proceeded with real commits to discover the extraction issues.

**Outcome**: Didn't add --mock flag - user proceeded with --test mode and real commits

### Question 2: Commit to Graph Confirmation

**User asked**: "can you make it so im prompted to commit this to the graph. the graph is empty, i recently wiped. i think that means the session.json needs to be adjusted?"

**Context**: User had research files on disk but graph was wiped. Wanted to commit retroactively but system wasn't prompting.

**I explained**:
- Research files exist in subdirectory
- session.json has `episode_count` but graph is empty
- Need --commit-to-graph flag to retroactively commit existing files

**Why this matters**: User workflow involves wiping graph during development, need way to backfill without re-running research

**Outcome**: Created --commit-to-graph flag to solve this workflow need

### Question 3: Extraction Investigation Scope

**User said**: "holy shit that was a ton of information but i loved it. i cannot finish though b/c my personal context window is filling up."

**Then**: "i want you to give me a summary, don't worry about giving code of what you found and specifics."

**Context**: After my 8-point investigation report (very detailed), user wanted digestible summary.

**I provided**: TL;DR version focusing on:
- Core problem (NER vs conceptual)
- Why it fails (two-stage extraction)
- Winning solution (hybrid approach)
- You're right about the other two (StrategicIntent, ExecutionOutcome will fail too)

**Why this matters**: Detailed technical investigations are valuable but need executive summary for decision-making. User's context window (mental, not just AI) has limits.

**Key exchange**:
```
User: "okay i want to ensure that nothing about next steps is documented. so i understand the issue...we are going back to reassess the overall schema"

Me: "Perfect - yes, that's exactly right."
```

This confirmed we were aligned on the decision without prescribing specific solutions.

### Question 4: Documentation Timing

**User asked**: "nice you're right. okay i want to ensure that nothing about next steps is documented."

**Context**: User wanted to document WHAT we learned and WHERE we are, but NOT prescribe WHAT to do next (since they're doing research to figure that out).

**I explained**: Documentation will capture:
- What we did
- What we discovered
- Where we're at (paused for redesign)
- No prescriptive next steps

**Why this matters**: Documentation should be descriptive (state), not prescriptive (instructions), when in discovery phase.

**Outcome**: CURRENT_WORK.md updated with investigation findings and "Status: Paused for redesign" without specific next actions

  - Refinement context files
  - **Purpose**: Real-world test data that revealed extraction issues

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Graphiti is NER, not conceptual extraction** - Designed for concrete nouns mentioned in text ("Arthur.ai"), not abstract concepts (ResearchFinding which IS the text structure) - Cost: 2 hours investigation to discover this fundamental constraint - See: CURRENT_WORK.md Key Learning #10

2. **Two-stage extraction has implications** - Graphiti extracts entity names first (Stage 1), then attributes for those named entities (Stage 2). Conceptual entities have no "name" to extract in Stage 1, so they fail before Stage 2 even runs. - Cost: 30 minutes tracing source code to understand pipeline - See: Investigation findings in this summary

3. **Protected fields exist in Graphiti** - Reserves `name`, `uuid`, `group_id`, `labels`, `created_at`, `summary`, `attributes`, `name_embedding` - Must use `company_name`, `tool_name` instead - Cost: 20 minutes debugging protected field errors - See: CURRENT_WORK.md Key Learning #12

4. **Entity type filtering reduces overhead** - Passing only relevant types per episode (research types: 4, strategic types: 3) saves 65% of entity type token overhead (370→130 tokens per extraction call) - Value: Better extraction quality with more context available - See: Investigation Section 5 (Context and Token Analysis)

5. **Test assumptions about tools** - We assumed Graphiti could extract any entity type (just pass Pydantic model), but investigation revealed it's specifically designed for NER - Cost: 4 hours total (implementation + discovery + investigation) - Lesson: Read tool architecture docs before designing schema - See: CURRENT_WORK.md Key Learning #14

6. **custom_prompt is internal-only** - Exists in Graphiti but NOT accessible via add_episode() parameters - only used internally during reflexion retries - Cost: 30 minutes source code investigation - Value: Ruled out one potential solution path - See: Investigation Section 2

7. **Graphiti makes 17+ LLM calls per episode** - 1 extraction + 1 reflexion + N attribute extractions (one per entity with custom attributes) - For episode with 15 entities = 17 calls - Value: Understand cost/latency implications - See: Investigation Section 1 (Extraction Flow)

8. **Work WITH tool design, not against it** - Considered forking Graphiti to modify prompts, but user chose to redesign schema instead - Lesson: Sometimes the better solution is adapting our approach rather than fighting the tool - See: Decision #3

9. **CLI flags improve workflow** - Adding --commit-to-graph flag enabled useful workflow (test → fail → fix → retry) without re-running expensive research - Implementation time: 30 minutes - Value: Saves hours of re-running research during development - See: main.py:476-581

10. **Async/sync mismatch creates warnings** - Calling async methods synchronously produces runtime warnings - Easy to miss in output but indicates design issue - Cost: 10 minutes to identify and fix - See: Problem #2

## Conversation Highlights

**These are the moments that led to breakthroughs:**

### The Protected Field Discovery

```
[After first test run with all failures]

Me: "CRITICAL FINDING! Both keys are set, but Graphiti will default to OpenAI..."

User: "this is what output when i finished..."
[Shows protected field errors]

Me: "Ah! We hit a critical issue - `name` is a protected field in Graphiti entities."
```

**Why this matters**: Quick pattern recognition (all 5 episodes, same error) led to immediate diagnosis

### The Extraction Investigation Request

```
User: "PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE: Helldiver Research Finding Extraction Investigation"

[Provides detailed 8-point investigation framework]

User: "Let me know what you find!"
```

**Why this matters**: User provided excellent investigation structure - this enabled systematic root cause analysis instead of random debugging

### The TL;DR Request

```
User: "holy shit that was a ton of information but i loved it. i cannot finish though b/c my personal context window is filling up. i want you to give me a summary"
```

**Why this matters**: Even detailed investigations need executive summaries - user's mental context has limits too

### The Schema Redesign Decision

```
User: "I personally think it's just going to be redoing the schema knowing ahead of time that we can only use entities. Then it should be a relatively quick fix after I work out what the schema is going to be."

Me: "Perfect - yes, that's exactly right."
```

**Why this matters**: User made clear architectural decision based on investigation findings - chose simplicity over complexity

### The Documentation Clarification

```
User: "okay i want to ensure that nothing about next steps is documented. so i understand the issue we ran into...so that's where we are at right now."

Me: "Perfect timing! Yes, absolutely..."
[Explained session achievements and open issues without prescribing solutions]
```

**Why this matters**: User wanted descriptive documentation (what happened, where we are) not prescriptive (what to do next) - they're in discovery mode

---

## Graphiti Architecture Deep Dive

**This section captures technical findings that might not fit elsewhere:**

### Extraction Pipeline Flow

```
add_episode() [graphiti.py:611]
  ↓
retrieve_previous_episodes() [graphiti.py:695-704]
  ↓
extract_nodes() [node_operations.py:88-199]
  ├─ Build entity_types context (lines 102-121)
  ├─ Call extract_text() prompt (extract_nodes.py:169-196)
  ├─ LLM returns ExtractedEntities (name + entity_type_id)
  ├─ Reflexion loop (check for missed entities)
  └─ Create EntityNode objects with name + labels
  ↓
resolve_extracted_nodes() [graphiti.py:734-740]
  ├─ Deduplicate entities (by name similarity)
  └─ Return deduplicated nodes
  ↓
extract_attributes_from_nodes() [node_operations.py:453-483]
  ├─ For each entity with custom type
  ├─ Call extract_attributes() prompt (extract_nodes.py:255-281)
  ├─ LLM extracts attributes based on Pydantic model
  └─ Update node.attributes dict
  ↓
Save to Neo4j
```

### Entity Types Context Format

```python
entity_types_context = [
    {
        'entity_type_id': 0,
        'entity_type_name': 'Entity',
        'entity_type_description': 'Default entity classification...',
    },
    {
        'entity_type_id': 1,
        'entity_type_name': 'ResearchFinding',
        'entity_type_description': 'Insight discovered through research.',  # From __doc__
    },
    # ... more types
]
```

**Serialized to prompt as**:
```
<ENTITY TYPES>
[
  {"entity_type_id": 0, "entity_type_name": "Entity", ...},
  {"entity_type_id": 1, "entity_type_name": "ResearchFinding", ...},
]
</ENTITY TYPES>
```

### Token Overhead Analysis

| Entity Type | Fields | Docstring | Est. Tokens |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Company | 4 | ~20 words | ~50 |
| Tool | 3 | ~15 words | ~40 |
| Methodology | 3 | ~15 words | ~40 |
| ResearchFinding | 6 | ~10 words | ~80 |
| StrategicIntent | 5 | ~10 words | ~70 |
| ExecutionOutcome | 7 | ~10 words | ~90 |
| **All 6 types** | - | - | **~370** |
| **Research types (4)** | - | - | **~210** |

**Available context**:
- Worker output: ~2,500 tokens
- All 6 types: 370 tokens → **Available: 2,130 (15% overhead)**
- Research 4 types: 210 tokens → **Available: 2,290 (8% overhead)**

**Savings from filtering**: 160 tokens per episode = 640 tokens per research session (4 workers)

### Why Deduplication Might Fail for Findings

Current deduplication (node_operations.py:241-350):
- Matches entities by similarity of `name` + `summary`
- Example: "Arthur AI" and "Arthur.ai" → same entity

For findings:
- Two workers might generate different names for same finding:
  - Worker 1: "Arthur.ai open-source strategy insight"
  - Worker 2: "Arthur Engine launch strategy analysis"
- Names differ, but content is same finding
- **Result**: Two separate ResearchFinding nodes (duplication)

**This was a risk we identified** but didn't need to solve since we're redesigning schema.

---

## Next Session Should

1. **Immediate**: User will research and design new entity schema based on Graphiti NER constraints
   - Focus: What concrete entities can we extract that capture research intelligence?
   - Examples to explore:
     - Finding as relationship between Episode and Entity? (not entity itself)
     - Separate finding storage? (outside Graphiti)
     - Enriched episode metadata? (findings in episode attributes)

2. **Soon**: Update entity_types.py with new schema
   - Remove or redesign meta-entities
   - Keep concrete entities (Company, Tool, Methodology - these work!)
   - Test extraction with new design

3. **Eventually**: Update worker prompts if needed based on new schema
   - Current prompts have execution formatting hints (still useful)
   - May need adjustments depending on final schema design

**Ready to**: Continue from clean state - code is functional, just needs schema redesign

**Blockers**: None - user has full context to make schema decisions

**Mental State**: Investigation complete, architectural constraints understood, ready for creative schema design phase

**Recommended approach**:
1. User researches NER-compatible schema patterns
2. Discusses options with Claude
3. Implements chosen design
4. Tests with existing Arthur AI research data

## Technical Context for AI

**Current State**: Schema implementation paused - needs redesign to align with Graphiti's NER architecture

**Last Commit**: dcf50f1 - feat(graphiti): Implement entity types integration and fix critical extraction issues

**Mental State**:
- Investigation phase complete (understand WHY it doesn't work)
- Decision made (redesign schema, don't fight Graphiti)
- Infrastructure ready (entity_types integration works for concrete entities)
- Waiting on user to research/design NER-compatible schema

**Context Loaded**:
- ✅ Full Graphiti architecture understanding (extraction pipeline, prompts, limitations)
- ✅ Working code for concrete entities (Company, Tool, Methodology extract successfully)
- ✅ Test data available (Arthur AI research files)
- ✅ Clear blockers identified (meta-entities incompatible with NER)
- ⏳ Pending: New schema design from user

**Files to reference next session**:
- `graph/entity_types.py` - Will need updating with new schema
- `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md` - Updated with investigation findings
- `context/Arthur_AI_GTM_strategy_for_smaller_companies/` - Test data for validation

## Session Statistics

**Commits**: 1 (comprehensive feature + investigation)
**Files Changed**: 20 (8 code files + 12 research/config files)
**Problems Solved**: 3 (protected fields, async warning, extraction architecture understanding)
**Decisions Made**: 3 (global group_id, commit-to-graph flag, pause for redesign)
**Key Learnings**: 10 (documented above)
**Time Span**: ~4-5 hours (implementation + testing + deep investigation)

**Investigation depth**: 8-point analysis covering:
1. Extraction flow (traced through source code)
2. custom_prompt parameter (found but inaccessible)
3. Entity type filtering (supported, recommended)
4. Multiple add_episode calls (works but creates duplicates)
5. Token usage (calculated overhead, savings from filtering)
6. Extraction quality (NER vs conceptual mismatch identified)
7. Performance impact (17+ LLM calls per episode)
8. Architecture recommendation (redesign schema)

**Code created**: 200+ new lines (entity types, commit-to-graph function, prompt enhancements)
**Code fixed**: 3 bugs (protected fields, async warning, group_id strategy)
**Documentation updated**: 1 major file (CURRENT_WORK.md comprehensive update)

## Quality Checklist

This summary should answer:
- ✅ "What happened this session?" → Implemented entity types, discovered NER limitation, investigated root cause, decided to redesign schema
- ✅ "Why did we make change X?" → Each change has "Why" context from conversation (protected fields fix, group_id simplification, commit-to-graph workflow)
- ✅ "What did user struggle with?" → Understanding why ResearchFinding failed, wanting TL;DR of investigation, ensuring no prescriptive next steps documented
- ✅ "What would I forget in 2 weeks?" → Graphiti is NER not conceptual, two-stage extraction, protected fields, custom_prompt is internal-only, 17+ LLM calls per episode
- ✅ "Where do I pick up next time?" → User researching NER-compatible schema, code ready for new design, test data available

**Unique insights captured**:
- User's "aha" moment about schema redesign being "relatively quick fix"
- Token overhead analysis showing 65% savings from filtering
- Graphiti architecture deep dive (extraction pipeline, prompts, deduplication)
- Decision archaeology (why each choice was made, alternatives considered)
- Conversation highlights showing user's decision-making process
