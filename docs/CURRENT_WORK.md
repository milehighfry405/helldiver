# Current Work Tracker

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19
**Active Sessions**: 3 research sessions on building optimal graph architecture

---

## üéØ Active Focus

**Building the perfect knowledge graph architecture for the "brain"**

This is foundational work - we're researching how to build the optimal graph that will:
1. Store all Helldiver research findings
2. Power Claude Skills execution layer
3. Provide omega context across all future use cases

---

## üìã What We Just Figured Out

### Group ID Strategy (Under Review)
- **Issue Discovered**: Hierarchical group_ids (per-session) break cross-session querying via MCP
- **Root Cause**: Graphiti MCP requires explicit group_id filtering (no wildcards)
- **Options Identified**:
  - Option 1: Single global `helldiver_research` (enables omega context, recommended)
  - Option 2: Keep hierarchical, manually pass all group_ids in searches
- **Decision Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Completing custom entities research first
- **Documented In**: [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Group ID Strategy section

### Critical Bugs Fixed (2025-01-19)
- ‚úÖ Timezone-aware datetime (episodes now have valid_at timestamps for MCP search)
- ‚úÖ Deep research episode naming (correct topic names instead of initial session name)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI rate limit retry logic (progressive backoff: 2s, 4s, 6s)
- ‚úÖ Retroactive commit metadata saving (session.json now updates after commits)
- ‚úÖ MCP compatibility validated (Claude Desktop can find and search episodes)

---

## üî¨ Active Research Sessions

### 1. Custom Entities for Graphiti Knowledge Graphs
- **Status**: In Progress - Refinement phase
- **Episodes Committed**: 4 initial research episodes (‚úÖ in Neo4j with correct valid_at)
- **Next Step**: Continue refinement conversation to determine custom entity schema
- **Key Question**: Should we use custom entities? If so, which types and attributes?
- **Location**: `context/Custom_entities_for_Graphiti_knowledge_graphs/`

### 2. Knowledge Graph Schema Design Principles
- **Status**: Deep research attempted (partial commit due to rate limits)
- **Episodes Committed**: 2 of 4 (Academic, Industry committed; Tool, Critical failed)
- **Next Step**: Retry commit with new rate limit logic to get remaining 2 episodes
- **Key Question**: Information-driven vs query-driven schema design?
- **Location**: Deep research within Custom Entities session

### 3. General Graph Architecture Research
- **Status**: Ongoing (synthesis of above sessions)
- **Purpose**: Inform final decisions on group_id, schema, custom entities
- **Output**: Will update [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) with final decisions

---

## üìç Immediate Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Complete Custom Entities Research**
   - Continue refinement conversation in Helldiver agent
   - Land on: Do we use custom entities? Which types? What attributes?
   - Update [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) with decision

2. **Decide Group ID Strategy**
   - Based on custom entities decision
   - Choose: Single global "helldiver_research" vs hierarchical
   - Update [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) with decision
   - Update code if changing from current hierarchical approach

3. **Finalize Graph Schema**
   - Document final schema in [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Create ADR-004 if schema is complex enough to warrant detailed rationale

4. **Wipe and Re-commit All Research** (if group_id strategy changes)
   - Delete all existing episodes from Neo4j
   - Re-commit with new group_id strategy
   - Validate MCP search works as expected

5. **Plan Claude Skills Integration**
   - Design how skills will query the graph
   - Document in [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Integration Points section

## ‚ùì Open Questions

### High Priority
- [ ] **Custom entities**: Use them? Which types? (ResearchFinding, Critique, Hypothesis?)
- [ ] **Custom entity attributes**: confidence_level? source_quality? strategic_relevance?
- [ ] **Group ID strategy**: Single global vs hierarchical?
- [ ] **Schema rigidity**: How much flexibility vs structure?

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Claude Skills integration pattern**: How should skills query the graph?
- [ ] **Performance targets**: What's acceptable query latency for execution agents?
- [ ] **Schema evolution**: How to handle changes as research evolves?

### Future Considerations
- [ ] **Multi-agent coordination**: How will other agents use this graph?
- [ ] **Execution result ingestion**: How to write skill execution results back to graph?
- [ ] **Cross-session synthesis**: How to surface insights across research topics?

## üö´ What We're NOT Working On Right Now

- Building features for the Helldiver agent (architecture is stable)
- Optimizing batch API usage (working fine)
- Refactoring existing code (no tech debt issues)
- Documentation cleanup beyond this session's changes

**Focus**: Graph architecture research and decisions only

---

## üéì Key Learnings This Session

1. **Graphiti's group_id is optional** - Default behavior searches entire graph (supports omega context vision)
2. **Enterprise use ‚â† our use** - Zep uses per-user isolation; we want cross-session synthesis
3. **Episode size matters** - 1,000-2,000 tokens optimal for entity extraction (our chunking is correct)
4. **Timezone-aware datetimes are critical** - Naive datetimes ‚Üí NULL valid_at ‚Üí MCP can't find episodes
5. **MCP compatibility requires planning** - Can't assume other AI agents will "just work" without correct metadata

## üîÑ Session Handoff Instructions

**For next AI assistant picking up this work:**

1. Read this file (CURRENT_WORK.md) first
2. Read [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) for current design state
3. Check `context/Custom_entities_for_Graphiti_knowledge_graphs/` - this is the active research
4. Continue refinement conversation to answer open questions
5. Update [GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md) when decisions are made
6. Update this file (CURRENT_WORK.md) with new progress/decisions

**Current priority**: Land on custom entities decision, then group_id strategy.

## üìÖ Timeline

- **2025-01-15**: Discovered group_id filtering issue with MCP
- **2025-01-19**: Fixed critical bugs (valid_at timestamps, episode naming, rate limits)
- **2025-01-19**: Created GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md to track design decisions
- **2025-01-19**: Currently in refinement phase for custom entities research
- **Next**: TBD - Land custom entities decision, then group_id strategy

**Remember**: This is foundational work. Take time to get it right. The graph will be the brain for everything we build.
