## **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & DEPLOYMENT**

### **Deployment Flexibility**
Deploy your way via SaaS, on-prem, or directly through GCP or AWS. Federated Architecture and Data Locality: Data security is enforced at the infrastructure level to minimize risk. Your data remains within your own environment and is never copied elsewhere.

### **Technical Stack**
Arthur leverages both ClickHouse and Postgres to handle different types of workloads. ClickHouse, used for OLAP workloads, is a horizontally scalable database management system that allows for high insert rates and fast serving of complex queries.

Arthur's streaming-first architecture allows a very large volume of data to be ingested reliably and efficiently in a non-blocking fashion. For queuing, Arthur uses Apache Kafka.

Arthur's platform core is written in the Go programming language, chosen because it's compiled to machine code, its runtime performance is up to 30x faster than interpreted languages, and it's built for concurrency and parallelism.

### **Scalability**
Arthur scales up and down to ingest up to 1MM transactions per second and deliver insights quickly.
