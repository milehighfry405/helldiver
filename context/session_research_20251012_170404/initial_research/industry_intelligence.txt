**2. Arthur Shield (LLM Firewall)**
Arthur Shield, the first firewall for large language models. Arthur Shield enables companies to deploy LLM applications like ChatGPT faster and more safely, helping to identify and resolve issues before they become costly business problems.

**Protection Against:**
- Arthur Shield provides configurable rules for real-time detection of PII or Sensitive Data leakage, Hallucination, Prompt Injection attempts, Toxic language, and other quality metrics
- Arthur Shield sits in front of large language models (LLMs) to check data going both in and out for potential risks and policy violations

**3. Arthur Bench (LLM Evaluation Tool)**
Arthur Bench, the most robust way to evaluate LLMs. Bench is an open-source evaluation tool for comparing LLMs, prompts, and hyperparameters for generative text models.

**Use Cases:**
- Arthur Bench helps companies compare the different LLM options available using consistent metrics so they can determine the best fit for their application in a rapidly evolving AI landscape. Not all applications require the most advanced or expensive LLMs — in some cases, a less expensive AI model can perform tasks equally as well. Additionally, bringing models in-house can offer greater controls around data privacy. Bench helps companies test and compare the performance of different models quantitatively with a set of standard metrics to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**4. Arthur Engine (Open-Source Evaluation Engine - March 2025)**
Arthur is launching the Arthur Engine, the first open-source, real-time AI evaluation engine designed to help teams monitor, debug, and improve Generative AI and traditional ML models.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Unlike traditional AI monitoring tools, Arthur Engine runs locally—preserving data sovereignty and eliminating compliance risks. Real-Time AI Evaluation – Instantly detect failures before they impact production. Active Guardrails – Intervene in real-time to prevent hallucinations and bad outputs. Customizable Metrics – Tailor evaluations to your specific AI use case. Privacy-Preserving & Secure – Keep all data inside your infrastructure. Works Across All Models – Supports GPT, Claude, Gemini, open weights models, and traditional ML.
