Arthur AI's downmarket opportunity hinges on identifying companies experiencing the painful transition from ML experimentation to production scale. The research reveals a stark reality: 87% of ML models fail before deployment, with only 32-53% ever reaching production, creating a massive addressable market of companies desperately needing monitoring solutions.

The ideal customer emerges at a specific inflection point: Series A-B companies ($10-50M raised) with 5-20 data scientists who've deployed 3+ models and are hiring MLOps engineers. These companies exhibit a predictable pattern - they've achieved initial ML success using tools like SageMaker and MLflow for experimentation, but as they scale, silent failures emerge. Models degrade without warning, accuracy plummets (Instacart's recommendation engine dropped from 93% to 61%), and the gap between data science and engineering teams widens. The $300M Zillow loss exemplifies the catastrophic potential of unmonitored models.

Technographic signals reveal companies in transition: those using AWS with Databricks or Snowflake are actively seeking solutions outside their native ecosystem, while MLflow users have experiment tracking but lack production monitoring. Job postings provide the clearest buying intent - companies posting 3+ ML engineer roles simultaneously or creating MLOps positions are 12-18 months post-funding and professionalizing infrastructure. Regulatory pressure accelerates urgency, with GDPR penalties reaching 4% of global revenue pushing compliance-driven adoption.

Detection requires monitoring multiple channels: Crunchbase for funding announcements mentioning "AI infrastructure," LinkedIn for MLOps hiring surges, engineering blogs discussing "model drift," and GitHub repos showing DIY monitoring attempts. The critical gap remains systematic detection methodology - while the research identifies what to look for, it lacks the operational playbook for finding these accounts at scale. Arthur's 3.1% market share versus Arize's 23.5% suggests significant growth potential if they can operationalize these insights into targeted outreach.
