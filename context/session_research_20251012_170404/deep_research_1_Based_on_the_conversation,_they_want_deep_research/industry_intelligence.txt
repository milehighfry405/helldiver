## **1. COMPANY CHARACTERISTICS INDICATING NEED FOR ML MODEL MONITORING**

### **1.1 Company Stage & Size Indicators**

**Series A-B Funded Startups (Sweet Spot)**
- Seed funding typically ranges $500K-$2M with valuations $3-6M, while Series A averages $10M at $40M pre-money valuation
- Series A funding lasts 12-18 months; Series B companies have $40M pre-money valuations and raise ~$25M
- Series A focuses on monetization with VCs investing around $23M; Series B supports scaling, averaging $33M

**AI/ML Infrastructure Investment Surge**
- AI infrastructure companies like Together AI raised $305M Series B at $3.3B valuation; TensorWave raised $100M Series A
- In Q3 2025, $45B (46% of global VC) went to AI sector; hardware/infrastructure raised $16.2B

**Team Size Signals**
- Smaller teams are more nimble and launch ML faster; larger teams have more requirements like uptime, privacy, security
- Common configuration is 2-3 data engineers per data scientist, can go up to 5 in complex organizations

### **1.2 Industry Verticals with High ML Adoption**

**Primary Targets:**
- Healthcare (medical imaging, drug discovery), Finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading), E-commerce (recommendations, demand forecasting)
- Automotive (self-driving cars), Manufacturing (predictive maintenance), Entertainment (content recommendation)

## **2. BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS: COMPANIES IN PAIN**

### **2.1 Scaling Models to Production**

**The 87% Failure Rate**
- According to Chris Chapo at Gap, 87% of ML models fail before deployment; studies suggest 87% fail in real-time environments
- At QCon SF 2024, Grammarly's Wenjie Zi shared that roughly 85% of ML projects stall before delivering business value
- O'Reilly's 2022 survey found only 26% of respondents have models deployed in production

**Production Deployment Challenges**
- Experts estimate 90% of ML models never make it to production; those that do take long time and require constant attention
- Many models never make it to production, or deployment takes much longer than necessary

### **2.2 Model Performance Degradation**

**Silent Failures & Drift**
- ML models return unreliable/biased predictions as "silent" errors; model responds even if input data is incorrect or significantly different
- The moment you put a model in production, it starts degrading; ML models trained on historical data become outdated
- A retail company's recommendation model initially boosted sales 15%, but due to silent data drift, accuracy degraded over 6 months, reducing sales by 5%

**Real-World Failure Examples**
- Zillow suffered $300M+ loss from poorly trained ML model trying to buy ~1,900 homes
- Instacart's model accuracy plummeted from 93% to 61% when customer shopping behavior changed

### **2.3 Infrastructure Professionalization Signals**

**Manual to Automated Transition**
- Many teams build state-of-the-art models but process is entirely manual; MLOps level 0 is common in businesses beginning to apply ML
- Without MLOps, data scientists manually develop each model using different tools, leading to inconsistencies and duplication

**Cross-Team Collaboration Pain**
- Engineers care about efficiency/stability; data scientists care about model performance; creates diffused responsibility
- Disconnect between data scientists and ML engineers; wider the gap, harder to productionize models

**Platform Usage Patterns**
- AWS customers often seek data solutions outside native AWS ecosystem, like Databricks or Snowflake
- Snowflake strong in analytics, AWS SageMaker great for ML experimentation, Google Vertex AI offers broad services; only Databricks unifies everything

### **3.2 MLOps Tool Stack**

- Evidently is open-source ML model monitoring system; helps analyze models during development, validation, or production

### **3.3 Development Frameworks**

**Programming Languages**
- Python in dramatic lead at ~72% of ML job postings; Python is Swiss Army knife for ML engineers
- Java surpassed SQL in 2025, appearing in 21% vs 18% of postings respectively

**ML Frameworks**
- PyTorch leads at 42% of postings; flexible, dynamic computation graphs, popular for deep learning and LLMs
- TensorFlow at 34% of postings; widely used in enterprise ML with robust production tools
