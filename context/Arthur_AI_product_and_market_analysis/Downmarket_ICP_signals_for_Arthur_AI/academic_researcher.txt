## 2. BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS: COMPANIES IN PAIN

### 2.1 Production Model Scaling Challenges

The risks of ML model failures vary from lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction to reputational damage and operational disruption, with the more crucial a model is to a company's success, the greater the need for robust monitoring.

**Silent Failure Patterns:**
- ML encounters "silent failures" where models return unreliable or biased predictions without error messages, as models typically respond as long as they can process incoming data inputs
- A machine learning system can predict an incorrect but valid output without raising an exception
- A lot can go wrong with a production model, and navigating model issues can be challenging for even the most seasoned AI engineer, yet over half of ML teams lack a reliable way to proactively surface when something is going wrong

**Model Degradation Indicators:**
- 91% of ML models degrade over time, with researchers focusing on studying machine learning models' behavior after deployment and how their performance evolves with unseen data
- Model functionality inevitably degrades over time due to several factors, with even subtle trends in the production environment radically altering behavior, especially true of advanced models using deep learning and non-deterministic techniques
- The moment you put a model in production it starts degrading, with steady and persistent decrease in technical performance metrics, as the world is constantly evolving and patterns in data change, making ML models trained on historical data become outdated

### 2.2 Infrastructure Professionalization Pain Points

**Resource Management Challenges:**
- Resource management has become a major part of data scientists' responsibilities, with challenges like sharing GPU servers among teams taking time away from data science tasks
- Managing ML models including data versioning, model versioning, deployment, and streaming open source tools takes significant time, and an ill-equipped machine learning infrastructure can greatly impact business results

**Team Collaboration Breakdown:**
- There can be a disconnect between IT and data science, with IT focused on availability and stability wanting uptime at all costs, while data scientists focus on iteration and experimentation wanting to break things
- ML management involves handoff difficulties between different teams, with startups struggling to ensure seamless collaboration between data scientists, engineers who understand production environments, and operations teams managing infrastructure

**Scaling Complexity:**
- As ML systems grow in complexity, they require more resources and infrastructure to handle increased computational demands, but managing and maintaining distributed systems becomes more challenging with scale, with more potential points of failure
- Even the most sophisticated teams have challenges scaling ML in production, with modern ML infrastructure not widely standardized and adopted, constraining sophisticated ML applications to large tech companies with massive budgets and in-house expertise

### 2.3 Data Drift and Concept Drift Symptoms

**Detection Challenges:**
- While ML models are trained on specific datasets expecting good performance on real-world data, assuming data remains static is unrealistic, with minor variations accumulating over time even without drastic changes
- Unlike traditional code, ML models are unique software entities whose performance can fluctuate over time due to changes in data input after deployment, requiring continuous ML monitoring to revalidate business value
- Feedback delay is a time lag between model predictions and receiving feedback, with monitoring input data distribution drift serving as a valuable proxy when ground truth labels are unavailable
