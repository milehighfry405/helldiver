## **1. COMPANY CHARACTERISTICS INDICATING NEED FOR ML MODEL MONITORING**

### **1.1 Company Size & Maturity**

**Downmarket Sweet Spot:**
- **Mid-market companies (200-2,000 employees)** with 5-50 data scientists/ML engineers
- 92% of organizations find business value from their ML models in production, indicating widespread adoption beyond enterprise

**Key Indicators:**
- ML models serving 1 to 1 million end users need monitoring from day 0, with potential customers including all using APM solutions plus lower-end market
- Companies with **multiple models in production** (3+ models deployed)
- Organizations experiencing **model deployment velocity** (deploying models quarterly or more frequently)

### **1.2 Industry Verticals with High ML Adoption**

**Primary Targets:**
- Technology & Engineering (28.2%), Health & Life Sciences (13%), Financial and Professional Services (10%), Primary Industries & Manufacturing (8.7%)
- ML driving decisions in financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, retail, education, and manufacturing across marketing, sales, BI, R&D, production, and IT

**Regulated Industries (High Priority):**
- Industries like finance and healthcare must meet strict regulatory requirements
- Scaling AI without governance is dangerous when each AI output is replicated millions of times, requiring balance between business value and oversight, risk management

### **1.3 Business Model Indicators**

**Revenue-Critical ML:**
- Companies where model performance drives business performance
- Organizations with **customer-facing ML applications** (recommendations, personalization, fraud detection)
- Companies with **operational ML** (supply chain optimization, demand forecasting, quality control)

**Cost of Failure:**
- Risks vary from lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction to reputational damage and operational disruption
- ML failures resulting in $300+ million losses (Zillow case)

## **2. BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS: COMPANIES IN PAIN**

### **2.1 Scaling Models to Production**

**Critical Pain Points:**

**High Failure Rates:**
- Only 32% of ML projects reached production in study of 300+ practitioners
- 87% of models fail before getting deployed according to Gap SVP of Data and Analytics
- 87% of Data Science projects never make it to Production

**Deployment Challenges:**
- Integration challenges (35%) reflect leadership failure; deployment requires buy-in from decision makers even with impressive integration challenges
- Only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production at organizations with AI experience; failure rates soar to nearly 90% for companies developing data-driven culture

**Model Performance Degradation:**
- After ML models are deployed in production, accuracy of results can deteriorate over time
- The moment you put a model in production, it starts degrading
- Data distribution model was trained on may change; fraud detection model trained on historical data might struggle when new fraud patterns emerge

### **2.2 Infrastructure Professionalization Signals**

**MLOps Maturity Progression:**

Level 0 (Manual): Manual ML workflows, data-scientist-driven process, every step manual including data preparation, ML training, model performance validation; requires manual transition between steps; data scientists hand over trained models as artifacts for engineering team to deploy; infrequent releases with models retrained only few times per year; no CI/CD considerations; no active performance monitoring

**Transition Indicators (Moving to Level 1-2):**
- Level of automation of Data, ML Model, and Code pipelines determines maturity; with increased maturity, velocity for training new models increases
- Previously took two to three weeks to understand and spin up infrastructure then start work; went from weeks to just click of button

**Advanced Maturity Needs:**
- Level 2 suitable for tech-driven companies updating models in minutes, retraining hourly or daily, simultaneously redeploying on thousands of servers; requires all Level 1 setup plus additional components

### **2.3 Production Failure Patterns**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**Data Drift:**
- Data drift refers to changes in distribution of features ML model receives in production, potentially causing decline in model performance
- Data drift is change in distribution of data; in production ML models, this is change between real-time production data and baseline data set representative of task model is intended to perform; production data can diverge or drift from baseline data over time due to changes in real world

**Training-Serving Skew:**
- Common practice in feature engineering is separate codebases for training and production; difference in frameworks may result in different outputs to same input data, causing skew
- Always double-check that features in production are computed same way as in training to avoid silent failures

**Monitoring Gaps:**
- Evaluating machine learning model health manually is very time-consuming and takes resources away from model development
- Missing alerts in recommender system: if no one watching model's click-through rates or conversion metrics, issue might only be discovered after revenue noticeably declines

## **3. TECHNOGRAPHIC SIGNALS: ML TOOLS & PLATFORMS**

### **3.1 Core ML Infrastructure Stack**

**Model Development Frameworks:**
- Python is non-negotiable; cloud fluency (especially AWS) just as important for deploying models at scale; both PyTorch and TensorFlow remain core competencies with no clear winner
- Machine learning appears in 69% of job postings

**MLOps Tools Adoption:**
- MLOps tools leverage AI to improve model quality monitoring, detect model drift, enhance overall operational performance
- MLOps tools include open-source like MLFlow, DVC, TFX, Kubeflow and cloud resources like AWS SageMaker, Valohai, Algorithmia, DataRobot, Neptune.ai

**Cloud Platforms:**
- Some data science positions require cloud certification, such as AWS (19.7%)
- Scalable storage solutions for AI applications include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage

### **3.2 Data Infrastructure Signals**

**Feature Stores:**
- Feature store is centralized operational data management system that allows data teams to store, share, reuse curated features for ML projects
- Efficient feature management crucial for scaling ML models; implementing centralized feature store allows organizations to store, share, reuse curated features easily; facilitates collaboration across teams and ensures consistent feature engineering practices

**Data Orchestration:**
- Apache Hadoop popular framework for processing large-scale datasets in distributed environment; offers reliable and scalable infrastructure for distributed ML; divides data processing tasks into smaller manageable chunks, distributes workload across multiple nodes
