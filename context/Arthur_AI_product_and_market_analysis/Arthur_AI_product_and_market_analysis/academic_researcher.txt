## **1. PRODUCT PORTFOLIO & CAPABILITIES**

### **Primary Products**

#### **Arthur Scope (Core Observability Platform)**
Provides observability across LLM, tabular, CV, and NLP models to monitor, measure, and improve model metrics. Key capabilities:
- Track model performance to detect and react to data drift
- Actionable insights into how models treat different population groups with fairness thresholds
- Explainability features to build trust and ensure compliance
- Supports all model types including multi-class and regressions

#### **Arthur Shield (LLM Firewall)**
Launched in May 2023 as the first firewall for large language models. Core protections:
- PII or sensitive data leakage prevention
- Blocking toxic, offensive, or problematic language generation
- Hallucination detection to prevent incorrect responses from being returned
- Detection of malicious prompts and prompt injection attacks

Shield provides prebuilt filters that continuously learn and can be customized to block known risks from being input into or output from an LLM.

#### **Arthur Bench (LLM Evaluation)**
Launched in August 2023 as an open-source evaluation product that compares LLMs, prompts, and hyperparameters for generative text models.

#### **Arthur Engine (Open-Source)**
Launched in 2025 as the first open-source, real-time AI evaluation engine for both Generative AI and traditional ML models. Key differentiators:
- Runs locally inside your own stack, preserving data sovereignty
- Real-time AI evaluation with active guardrails that intervene to prevent bad outputs
- Privacy-preserving and secure with no external access or data leaks

#### **Arthur Chat**
Turnkey, secure chat platform that empowers companies to quickly deploy AI-powered chat apps leveraging proprietary enterprise data.

### **Technical Capabilities & Differentiation**

**Model Agnosticism:**
Model agnostic and fit for traditional ML, GenAI, or agentic systems

**Deployment Flexibility:**
Deploy via SaaS, on-prem, or directly through GCP or AWS

**Integration:**
Works seamlessly with all leading data science and MLOps tools, including Databricks, Amazon SageMaker, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SingleStore, and Salesforce

**Architecture:**
Highly scalable microservices architecture makes it the leading platform for enterprises running high-performing ML models at scale

Federated architecture with data locality ensures data stays within your environment, never copied elsewhere
