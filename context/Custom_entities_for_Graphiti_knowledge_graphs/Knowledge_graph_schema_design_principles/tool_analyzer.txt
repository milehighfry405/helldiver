# Knowledge Graph Schema Design Principles: Deep Research Report

## Executive Summary

Knowledge graph schema design is a critical yet under-documented aspect of building effective knowledge graphs. While good schema design is very important for relational databases, it's perhaps even more important and central for knowledge graphs. This research synthesizes principles, patterns, frameworks, and trade-offs from both RDF-based semantic web approaches and property graph implementations.

## 1. Foundational Concepts

### 1.1 Schema vs. Ontology Distinction

Ontologies represent the backbone of the formal semantics of a knowledge graph. They can be seen as the data schema of the graph. They serve as a formal contract between the developers of the knowledge graph and its users regarding the meaning of the data in it.

**Key Distinction:**
- An ontology is like a data model, but subtly different. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) when used for data modeling is a rigid listing of classes and properties (or attributes) that fall under each class.
- Ontologies lay a solid foundation for building adaptable and scalable knowledge graphs. Their flexible and dynamic nature allows users to tweak and expand the graph's structure as needed while maintaining its integrity. Designed to evolve with changing contexts and newly acquired knowledge, ontologies ensure that a knowledge graph stays accurate and aligned with its domain.

### 1.2 Core Components

A knowledge graph has three major components: nodes (the data entities), relationships between the nodes, and organizing principles. An organizing principle refers to the way you organize the data conceptually into categories, hierarchies, or other principles that are important to the use case.

**Schema Components (WhyHow Framework):**
Entities are the elements represented as nodes in the graph. For example, in a knowledge graph about movies, entities could be individual movies, actors, directors, genres, etc. Relations are the graph edges, they denote the connections or associations between entities in the graph.

Patterns define recurring arrangements or sequences of entities and relations that are allowed to occur in the graph. They constrain the types of triples that are created.

## 2. Design Paradigms and Standards

### 2.1 RDF/RDFS/OWL Stack

Ontology, taxonomy, and graph standards like OWL (Web Ontology Language), RDF (Resource Description Framework), RDFS (RDF Schema), and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) are crucial for organizing, representing, and reasoning about data in a structured, machine-readable way. They are used to model complex relationships in domains such as finance.

**Technology Layers:**
- RDF (Resource Description Framework): RDF is a framework for representing data in a graph format where entities are described using triples (subject, predicate, object).
- RDFS (RDF Schema): RDFS is an extension of RDF that provides basic vocabulary and structure for RDF data, allowing for the definition of classes and properties.
- OWL (Web Ontology Language): OWL is used to create more complex ontologies with richer relationships, enabling advanced reasoning capabilities.

**Expressivity and Performance:**
Knowledge graphs, represented in RDF, provide the best framework for data integration, unification, linking and reuse, because they combine: Expressivity: The standards in the Semantic Web stack – RDF(S) and OWL – allow for a fluent representation of various types of data and content: data schema, taxonomies and vocabularies, all sorts of metadata, reference and master data. Performance: All the specifications have been thought out, and proven in practice, to allow for efficient management of graphs of billions of facts and properties.

### 2.2 Property Graph Model (Neo4j/LPG)

Neo4j uses a property graph database model. The Neo4j property graph database model consists of: Nodes describe entities (discrete objects) of a domain. Nodes can have zero or more labels to define (classify) what kind of nodes they are.

Relationships describe a connection between a source node and a target node. Relationships always have a direction (one direction). Relationships must have a type (one type) to define (classify) what type of relationship they are. Nodes and relationships can have properties (key-value pairs), which further describe them.

**Schema in Property Graphs:**
A schema in Neo4j refers to indexes and constraints. However, For most applications that are not just based on explorative work, one thing holds true: You can't have no schema. There will always be a schema.

### 2.3 RDF vs. Property Graph Trade-offs

Two major approaches dominate this space: RDF (Resource Description Framework), often coupled with OWL (Web Ontology Language) for reasoning. LPG (Labeled Property Graphs), popular in graph databases such as Neo4j. Both are used in various enterprise and academic settings, each with unique strengths and trade-offs.

**Reasoning Capabilities:**
OWL Reasoners (e.g., HermiT, Pellet, Fact++): Provide sound and complete reasoning for your ontology. They ensure all logical consequences are derived exactly as the axioms specify. When you say "RDF knowledge graph reasoning," you typically mean OWL or description logic reasoning.

If you need formal inference (e.g., advanced domain modeling, data validation), RDF/OWL stands out. If you just need to query data relationships quickly and store them in a simpler graph form, LPG is very appealing.

## 3. Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)

### 3.1 Pattern-Based Design Philosophy

Patterns allow a complex system to be modularised and self-explaining, hence more (re)usable. This is true in architecture and in software engineering, where patterns provide solutions to recurrent problems and form a language for supporting communication among designers. Knowledge graphs are complex systems and ontologies are a means to govern them as far as their organisation, semantics, and interoperability are concerned.

Ontology design patterns play a crucial role for enabling such interoperability, however there is still lack of proper tools for widely spreading their adoption.

### 3.2 Common Design Patterns

**Class Hierarchy Pattern:**
The class hierarchy pattern is one of the most basic and fundamental design patterns for ontologies. It involves organizing classes into a hierarchical structure, with more general classes at the top and more specific classes at the bottom. This pattern is useful for capturing the relationships between different types of entities and concepts, and can help you build a taxonomy that is easy to navigate and understand.

**Property and Role Hierarchies:**
The role hierarchy pattern is similar to the property hierarchy pattern, but focuses specifically on the relationships between different roles that entities can play. For example, you might have a role hierarchy that includes roles like "employee", "manager", and "CEO", with more specific roles like "software engineer" and "sales manager" nested underneath "employee" and "manager", respectively. This pattern is useful for capturing the complex relationships between different types of entities and the roles they play in your organization or domain.

### 3.3 Empirical Pattern Extraction

It introduces a novel method for extracting empirical ontology design patterns (EODPs) from ontologies, and another for extracting EODPs from knowledge graphs whose schemas are implicit. Both methods are applied to ontologies and knowledge graphs frequently adopted and reused, such as Wikidata.

The first method is able to group the extracted EODPs in clusters that are named conceptual components. Each conceptual component represents a generalised modelling problem, for example representing collections. As EODPs are fragments possibly extracted from different ontologies, some of them will fall in the same cluster, meaning that they are expected to be implemented solutions to the same modelling problem, e.g. different solutions to model collections. Hence, EODPs and conceptual components enable the empirical observation of modelling solutions to common modelling problems adopted by different ontologies, therefore supporting their comparison.

## 4. Schema Design Principles

### 4.1 Use Case-Driven Design

Before diving into implementation, clearly define what problem your knowledge graph will solve. Knowledge graphs excel at organizing and querying complex data that, in a relational model, would require complex queries and often frequent changes.

The first step in building a comprehensive, efficient, and relevant knowledge graph is to determine what is the problem it is intended to solve. Even more narrowly, what are the business questions that the knowledge graph should be able to answer?

**Query-Driven Approach:**
To identify the entities and relationships, it is useful to make an inventory of the questions that will be asked of the data. This approach is often called "query-driven" or "access patterns"-oriented. Agile user stories express the needs which influence the shape and content of the graph data model.

### 4.2 Start Small and Iterate

When building your knowledge graph, it's important to start small. Start with a small subset of your data and gradually add more as you become more comfortable with the tool you are using. Starting small will help you avoid getting overwhelmed and will allow you to focus on building a high-quality knowledge graph.

We believe that graph-based RAG systems are most performant when using graphs that are small and narrowly-scoped to your unique view of the world. By including only the data that you need for your use case, you reduce the likelihood of poisoning your context window with potentially irrelevant information and causing hallucinations. Smaller graphs are also easier to maintain and modify, giving developers much more control to build accurate, reliable RAG systems.

### 4.3 Standard Vocabularies

When designing your schema, it's important to use standard vocabularies whenever possible. Standard vocabularies, such as Schema.org and Dublin Core, provide a common language for describing entities and relationships. Using standard vocabularies will make it easier for others to understand and use your knowledge graph.

A key consideration when designing your ontology is whether you start from scratch and build a highly custom model specifically geared for your organization's domain, or you instead investigate and leverage pre-defined ontologies that are widely used and then enhance them to fit your needs. In our approach, we commonly start by reviewing common public ontologies like FOAF, GEO, ORG, and schema.org to determine their alignment with the specific use case we are working on.

### 4.4 Unique Identifiers

When defining your entities, it's important to use unique identifiers. Unique identifiers, such as URIs, ensure that your entities can be easily identified and linked to other entities in your knowledge graph.

In order to provide value beyond SEO, the entities in your Schema Markup must be represented by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). In JSON-LD, these identifiers appear as @ids to give the entities in your markup a unique identity that disambiguates and differentiates them from other entities – similar to how a social security number can uniquely differentiate people who may share the same name. While Schema Markup still provides SEO value without including @ids, they are a requirement for the markup to become a reusable knowledge graph.

## 5. Schema Types: Fixed vs. Dynamic

### 5.1 Schema Flexibility Spectrum

At first glance, it may seem that one should default to having a system that can accord for dynamic data and dynamic schema as it may be the most flexible and therefore powerful (i.e. the top left). However, this may not necessarily be true. There are certain instances where the underlying data has a range of irrelevant information that one does not wish to have represented in the graph as it may create unnecessary clutter within the knowledge graph, making graph extraction (i.e. the process of extracting data from a graph) more complicated and error prone.

### 5.2 Fixed Schema/Fixed Data

In this scenario, your data does not change, and the schema does not change. An example of this type of graph is Document Hierarchies. In document hierarchies, you simply want to create a graph that represents the fixed semantic structure of your document so that you can perform deterministic retrieval of raw text. This helps you guarantee that you're retrieving data from the correct section of a document, something that is difficult to do with semantic similarity searches alone. Thus, creating graphs of your documents and their unique structure, you can retrieve chunks from specific documents or sections/subsections of a document.

### 5.3 Fixed Schema/Dynamic Data

In this scenario, the data is continuously changing and is continuously being streamed in, but the schema remains fixed. An example of this type of graph is where you have a fixed set of things that you want to extract and store consistently from a range of data (or even multiple types of the same report over time). With a discrete and fixed schema, you can then use the schema to collect and store a specific sub-set of data from a range of unstructured text.

### 5.4 Schema-Adaptable Construction

Schema-adaptable knowledge graph construction refers to the set of principles, systems, and methodologies enabling knowledge graphs (KGs) to be constructed and maintained in the presence of evolving, heterogeneous, or user-defined schemas. This paradigm is distinguished by the need to flexibly accommodate new types, relations, and structural patterns without the rigidity of a static, pre-defined ontology, thus supporting adaptation to novel domains, sources, and information needs.

## 6. Schema Validation with SHACL

### 6.1 SHACL Overview

This document defines the SHACL Shapes Constraint Language, a language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. These conditions are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. RDF graphs that are used in this manner are called "shapes graphs" in SHACL and the RDF graphs that are validated against a shapes graph are called "data graphs".

### 6.2 Why SHACL is Needed

Because RDFS schemas and OWL ontologies describe a dataset's structure by listing classes
