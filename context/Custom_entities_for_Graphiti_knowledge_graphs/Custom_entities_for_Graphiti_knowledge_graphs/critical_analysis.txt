Yes, I understand what you're trying to do! Let me review this conversation and confirm my understanding:

## What You're Building

You have a **structured 4-agent research pipeline** that produces knowledge for execution:

**Pipeline Architecture:**
- 3 research agents (4k tokens each) → primary research
- 1 critical analyst (2k tokens) → gap analysis, devil's advocate
- 1 synthesis agent (2k tokens) → user context about WHY this matters
- **Total: 5 episodes per research session, 14k tokens**

**The Goal:**
Build an execution-grade knowledge graph that captures the nuance and judgment of 20+ domain experts. This isn't academic - it's about creating a "brain" that enables execution agents to act with expert-level knowledge and make money.

**The Key Insight:**
User context (the "why this matters" layer) transforms information into actionable knowledge. Your questions about GTM strategy, for example, aren't just metadata - they're what makes the research executable.

## What You Need from Research

You want me to research **all three phases** in one session:

1. **Phase 1: Graphiti Deep Dive**
   - How entity extraction actually works
   - What context OpenAI sees during extraction
   - How episodes relate to entities
   - What makes Graphiti different from other knowledge graphs
   - What custom entities actually enable vs defaults

2. **Phase 2: Schema Design Principles**
   - When custom entities add value vs complexity
   - How to preserve provenance/metadata
   - Best practices for research pipeline → knowledge graph architectures

3. **Phase 3: Decision Framework**
   - Given your specific constraints (5 episodes, known structure, execution focus), what's optimal?
   - How to evaluate "is this preserving enough signal?"
   - Documented reasoning you can commit to the graph

## Your Specific Concerns

1. **You're new to knowledge graphs** - you want to understand how to use Graphiti the way it was *intended* to be used, not fight against its design

2. **You want to optimize for Graphiti's unique benefits** - understand what makes it different from other KGs and ensure you're leveraging those advantages

3. **You need a decision framework for the future** - this should work not just for this project, but for any user/problem/domain going forward

4. **The reasoning must be documented** - so when you commit this research to the graph, future you (or future agents) understand why you made these choices

## What I'm Going to Research

I'll dig into:
- Graphiti's documentation and architecture
- How the entity extraction process works (what OpenAI sees, what gets preserved)
- Whether episode metadata (agent role, prompt) is available during extraction
- Production implementations and case studies
- Knowledge graph schema design principles
- Decision frameworks for custom vs default entities
- Specific recommendations for your closed-system research pipeline

## My Understanding of the Core Question

**"Would custom entities improve the signal stored and retrieved in the graph for your specific use case?"**

This breaks down into:
- Does Graphiti's extraction process "see" which agent produced which episode?
- Can you preserve the distinction between "primary research fact" vs "critical analysis" vs "user context" in the graph structure?
- Would custom entities enable better queries for execution agents?
- Or is the episode-level separation sufficient?

---

**Is this accurate?** Any corrections or additions before I start the research?

The key thing I want to confirm: You want me to go deep on Graphiti's documentation specifically (not just general KG theory), understand its design philosophy, and then synthesize that with schema design principles to give you a concrete recommendation with documented reasoning. Correct?
