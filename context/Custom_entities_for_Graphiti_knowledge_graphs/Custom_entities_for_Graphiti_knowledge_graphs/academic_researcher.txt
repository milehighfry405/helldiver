Perfect - I understand completely now. Let me confirm the updated architecture and then we'll go deep:

**Your System (Updated):**
- 3 research agents: 4k tokens each
- 1 critical analyst: 2k tokens  
- 1 synthesis (user context): 2k tokens
- **Total: 14k tokens across 5 episodes per research session**
- Goal: Build an execution-grade knowledge graph that captures the nuance of 20+ domain experts

**What You Need:**
A complete research package covering:
1. How Graphiti actually works (technical deep dive)
2. Schema design principles for knowledge graphs
3. A decision framework for your specific use case with documented reasoning

**Your Feedback:**
You want to make sure we understand how to use Graphiti the way it was *intended* to be used, leverage its unique benefits vs. other knowledge graphs, and ensure we're optimizing for those things. You're new to knowledge graphs, so you want the full picture to make an informed decision.

I'm going to do **Option A - all three phases in this session**. This will give you:
- Technical understanding of Graphiti's design
- General principles of when custom entities matter
- Specific recommendations for your pipeline
- Documented reasoning you can commit to the graph

This will take about 5-7 minutes of deep research across Graphiti's documentation, knowledge graph design literature, and schema design best practices.

**Ready to start?** Type 'go' and I'll begin the deep dive.
