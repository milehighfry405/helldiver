Clay's platform architecture reveals a fundamental tension: while Sculptor accelerates table creation to 70-80% completion, the remaining refinement requires deep understanding of Clay's waterfall enrichment system—which sequentially queries 75+ data providers until finding valid data, tripling coverage while minimizing credit waste. This matters because your blank-table-to-pipeline workflow depends on mastering the conditional logic layer that Sculptor can't fully automate: JavaScript-based formulas controlling when enrichments fire, which providers to use for specific company types, and how to chain AI research through Claygent (processing 500K daily tasks across 30% of users) to extract custom signals beyond standard databases. The platform's true power emerges through Write to Table functionality, automatically linking company-to-contact relationships while maintaining data integrity, then feeding enriched data through AI Snippets for personalized messaging at scale. Critical gaps remain: Clay offers no direct API access (only webhooks), credit costs lack transparency beyond "1-2 credits for most actions," and formula limitations aren't fully documented—meaning you'll discover JavaScript subset restrictions through trial-and-error. The research confirms your intuition: Sculptor handles initial table structure and basic enrichments, but extracting nuanced segment signals requires manual configuration of conditional runs, waterfall sequences, and Claygent prompts using their S.P.I.C.E. framework. For your proof-of-concept, the path is clear: Find Companies with ICP filters, build conditional enrichment waterfalls, deploy Claygent for custom signal extraction, Write to Table for contacts, then AI Snippets for messaging—but expect to spend significant time fine-tuning the logic Sculptor leaves incomplete.
