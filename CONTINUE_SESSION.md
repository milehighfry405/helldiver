# Continue Helldiver Research Agent Session

This session is being continued from a previous conversation. The conversation is summarized below:

## Current State

We are working on the **Helldiver Research Agent** - a multi-agent research system that commits findings to a Graphiti knowledge graph.

### What We Just Completed

1. **Fixed query extraction bug** - Added `original_query` field to preserve the initial research query when deep research overwrites `session.query`
2. **Fixed retroactive migration** - Built system to detect and commit old research episodes from before multi-episode feature existed
3. **Added user prompts for migration** - When migrating old sessions, system now prompts user for:
   - Original research query (e.g., "arthur ai based on out nyc")
   - Clean topic names for deep research episodes (e.g., "ICP signals for downmarket")
4. **Set up GitHub repo** - Pushed to https://github.com/milehighfry405/helldiver.git with proper .gitignore (excludes API keys, includes migration session)

### Current Bugs (Still Need Fixing)

**MIGRATION BUG:** When running `python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"`:
- ✅ Initial episode name is correct: "Research: arthur ai based on out nyc" (after user prompt)
- ❌ Deep research episode name is still wrong: "Research: Based on the conversation, they want deep research"
- **Expected:** Should prompt user for clean topic name, but the prompt isn't showing

**Root cause:** The detection logic in [main.py:1400-1405](main.py#L1400-L1405) checks if topic looks verbose, but the prompt might not be executing correctly.

### What Needs To Happen Next

1. **Test the migration flow again** - Run the agent and verify both prompts appear:
   ```bash
   python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"
   ```
   - First prompt: "What was the ORIGINAL research query?" → Enter: `arthur ai based on out nyc`
   - Second prompt: "Enter a clean topic name" → Enter something like: `ICP signals for downmarket`

2. **Verify mock output shows correct episode names:**
   - Initial: `"Research: arthur ai based on out nyc"` ✅
   - Deep: `"Research: ICP signals for downmarket"` (or whatever clean name you provide)

3. **Once validated in mock mode** - Install graphiti_core and commit to real graph

### Key Technical Context

**Multi-Episode Architecture:**
- Episode 1: Initial research (committed when research completes)
- Episodes 2+: Each deep research session (committed when completed)
- Final episode: Refined understanding (committed at explicit commit, links to all research)

**Session State Management:**
- `session.query` - Current query (gets overwritten by deep research)
- `session.original_query` - Original query (never overwritten) ← **newly added**
- `session.initial_episode_id` - ID of initial research episode
- `session.deep_episode_ids` - List of deep research episode IDs

**Retroactive Migration:**
- Detects old sessions without episode IDs
- Prompts user for original query and clean topic names
- Commits episodes retroactively with correct metadata

### Key Files

- [main.py](main.py) - Core agent logic with multi-episode commits and migration
- [graphiti_client.py](graphiti_client.py) - Knowledge graph interface (currently in mock mode)
- [context/session_research_20251012_170404/](context/session_research_20251012_170404/) - Migration test session

### Environment Setup on New Computer

1. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milehighfry405/helldiver.git
   cd helldiver
   ```

2. Create `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Test migration flow:
   ```bash
   python main.py --refine "context/session_research_20251012_170404"
   ```

### User's Goal

User wants to:
1. ✅ Commit all research (initial + deep + refinement) to Graphiti knowledge graph
2. Use the graph to build Clay tables for Arthur AI lead generation
3. Generate ICP signals, fit scores, messaging, and ad copy
4. Hand off to Arthur's AE who already wants these leads

### Next Steps

Continue testing the migration flow until both prompts work correctly and episode names are clean. Once validated, install graphiti_core and commit to real graph.

## For Claude Code

Please continue working on fixing the deep research topic extraction bug. The prompt should be showing but isn't - verify the logic at [main.py:1407-1413](main.py#L1407-L1413) is executing correctly during migration.
