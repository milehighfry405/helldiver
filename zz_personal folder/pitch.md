🧭 GTM Factory — Final Founder Pitch Outline (Your Format)
Intro

Name + Role: “I’m Ben Fry, founder of GTM Factory.”

Experience context: “I’ve spent the past year as a GTM Engineer inside a 2,200-person company.”

Insight: “That experience showed me how inefficient GTM really is.”

3-Part Breakdown of Inefficiency:

Propagation – Leadership forms strategy and pushes it down through layers to ICs.

Distortion – Context gets stripped, the signal gets distorted by noise, and what’s executed rarely matches intent.

Feedback chaos – When learnings travel back up, competing OKRs and metrics make the data inconsistent or meaningless.

→ Core framing: “It’s not a people problem — it’s an information architecture problem inside modern orgs.”

Solution

Premise: “GTM Factory fixes that by creating a single loop between strategy, execution, and learning.”

How it works:

A small group forms a hypothesis — who to reach, what to say, why.

The product captures that reasoning and executes it through integrated workflows.

Outcomes flow back automatically, updating the same model that drove the action.

Each cycle makes the motion more precise, faster, and more aligned.

Seller enablement: “Because every decision and rationale is encoded, sellers know exactly how to position, what to avoid, and what matters most in each conversation.”

System outcome: “Over time, the process compounds — every run improves the next.”

Why Now

AI threshold: “For the first time, AI can manage the repeatable GTM work — research, enrichment, outreach, analysis — better and faster than humans.”

Human leverage: “Humans provide direction, context, and relationships — the part AI still can’t replicate.”

Inflection: “That combination makes it possible to close the loop between strategy and execution — something that wasn’t possible before this generation of AI.”

Vision / Outcome

Augmentation, not automation: “GTM Factory supercharges sellers — belt-feeds them the right opportunities, messaging, and context so they can focus on closing.”

Scalability: “Small teams can now operate with the precision and velocity of a much larger org.”

System intelligence: “Every loop compounds learning — creating a self-improving GTM motion that scales itself.”
